    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As narcisisstic as it might sound, I decide to start travel-blogging in English because I think the stories are so engaging and informative that whoever couldn’t read it misses out a lot😂 Also it’d be a great chance to improve my English writing skills. I have never really given up on my childhood dream of becoming a writer, and who knows… maybe this is a start.</p><p>Anyways, first things first… Independence day 2019. Iceland.</p><p>The idea of spending this Independence Day struck me at the end of May, when I started planning for the next long weekend and realized that omigod I could get out of the States for this one!!! Iceland was clearly the best choice – it was actually closer to NYC than the West Coast. Within a week, I paid for a flight and submitted my visa application.</p><p>I started getting anxious two weeks before the trip, which honestly had seldom happened to me. The main reason was that I would be driving alone for the entire trip (I had never done so before, let alone in a foreign country…) I learned online that the road would be hard to drive when it got windy, and was terrified that I might be trapped in the wind and would never go back.</p><p>Regardless, July 4 approached, and off I went.</p><p><img src="/images/iceland-itinerary.png" alt="Itinerary"></p><p>Simply put, Iceland gave me the impression of “European version of Japan.” When I think of Japan, I would think about hot springs, volcanoes, all sorts of geolocical activities, being an island between two continents, tidiness and people’s obsession with it. And you got them all in Iceland. (Well, maybe minus the anime.)</p><p>My Itinerary:</p><ul><li><strong>July 4:</strong> Arrived at Keflavik Airport and went through the customs before 9am. Got my car at 10:20, parked at Þingvellir National Park at 12 to join the Silfra snorkling tour. After the 2-hour tour I wandered around at the National Park for an hour, and spent the evening at The Great Geysir, Gulfoss and the Secret Lagoon.</li><li><strong>July 5:</strong> Noon at Geothermal Park in Hveragerði, and afternoon and evening with the “Inside the Volcano” tour. After the tour I drove to Reykjavik and spent the night there, completing Golden Circle.</li><li><strong>July 6:</strong> One day trip to and from Snæfellsnes Peninsula, and went directly to the airport from there to catch my 1am flight on 7th.</li></ul><p>Basically, an in-depth Golden Circle tour and the peninsula. Looking back, I think the only flaw in this itinerary is that I should move “Inside the Volcano” to the morning of July 5, and head off to Snæfellsnes right after that. Maybe I originally planned to go further east on the morning of July 5 and decided against it when I woke up at 9am that day… As a result, I was out of ideas of where to kill time before “Inside the Volcano,” and on the 6th I had to drive for 7 hours, with a flight to catch at the end of the day…</p><p>My mate David recommended me Jökulsárlón at the south of Vatnajökull National Park. Being on a tight schedule, however, I saved that for some future winter so I could see the blue ice cave as well.</p><p>I highly recommend the site <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide to Iceland</a>, which helped me a lot when I was prepping my trip. It has tips and advices written in different languages. I read the same article in Chinese and in English, and was surprised that they were not translations of one another. It was clear from the content that the Chinese version were specifically targeted towards Chinese travelers, and the English version would address more habits and interests of European/American readers.</p><h3 id="Getting-Around"><a href="#Getting-Around" class="headerlink" title="Getting Around"></a>Getting Around</h3><p>It was astoundingly quick to get through the customs in Keflavik Airport in the morning. My flight arrived at 8:20am, and within 20 minutes I was admitted by the customs. I had to find a cafe in the airport to kill time…</p><p>I rented my car rental company named “Blue Car Rental,” and was offered a white Hyundai from 2015… there really wasn’t newer car models than that. Not sure whether it was about just that rental car company or about whole Iceland, but they were quite strict on the exact time you rent and return the car. I arrived at their service counter at 9:30 and was asked to wait until 10am… just because I said I’d come at around 10 when I reserve. The same happened when I returned the car – I got there a few hours early and was asked “do you really want to return it now?”</p><p><img src="/images/hyundai.jpg" alt="Hyundai"></p><p>To my immense relief, it wasn’t windy at all where I was going. The highways were not built as well as those in North America, but still easily drivable. Sometimes the road surface could be uneven which made the car rocking left and right, and that sometimes made me nervous. Nothing more than that.</p><p>Icelandic drivers were generally quite nice. On average they drive 100~110kmph on highways but usually no more than 120. Nothing like those crazy New Jersey drivers.</p><p>A rule of thumb of driving in Iceland was that you couldn’t just pull off wherever you want. I knew you were not really supposed to do that in other countries as well, but in Iceland, people seriously make a point of reminding you in everything you could read about driving there. I remember the rental company telling me that I would be fined for pulling off at random places, so I had to forgo many photo opportunities…</p><p>Driving alone was not as unnerving as I expected, and the satisfaction of the control freak inside me did give me glowing pleasure. Still, it started getting boring after an hour or so. I was so bored that I tried chatting with Siri on my iPhone, only to realize she was as uninteresting as my roadtrip back to the airport…Also, driving alone meant that you could not afford being sleepy. You might say that I could just go get some sleep at some gas station but… what if I needed to catch a flight?</p><h3 id="Eating-amp-Sleeping"><a href="#Eating-amp-Sleeping" class="headerlink" title="Eating &amp; Sleeping"></a>Eating &amp; Sleeping</h3><p>Before the trip, one my colleagues reminded me to bring some instant noodles, because their food tasted really bad for Asians’ flavor preferences, and so I did.</p><p>I ate two meals at restaurants. The first one contained a lamb soup and the “skyr” cheese. Basically “skyr” is some sort of Icelandic cheese that looks and tastes exactly like yogurt, and so makes good desserts. The second meal was in an Italian restaurant on Snæfellsnes Peninsula named “Sker.” The seafood pasta tasted superb, even by New York standard.</p><p><img src="/images/skyr.jpg" alt="Skyr"></p><p>I hadn’t have a chance to eat puffin or hakarl (colleague said I made a good choice,) but I had lamb soup. Twice. I didn’t know what was with Iceland and lamb, but… they offer lamb soup to tourists at the end of adventure tours which looked and tasted exactly the same as what I had in the restaurant. Moreover, I strongly suspect <strong>they used lamb infusion in their handsoaps</strong> - everytime after I wash my hands, they smell like those lamb soup I had. It has been three weeks since I came back from Iceland, and I was still staying far away from lamb when I eat…</p><p>I spent two nights in different hostels with shared bathrooms. I will go above and beyond to recommend the first one, <a href="https://www.geysirhestar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geysir Hestar</a>. It was a few minutes drive to the Great Geysir, and offered me the best hostel experience I could remember. I paid for a single, and out of my bedroom window were horses and mountains (the hostel did horseriding trips on the side.) The sheets were clean, beds were comfy, hosts were nice, and the interior felt sort of vintage - I was given a big silver vintage key to lock and unlock my bedroom door. They also put tons of towels in the bathrooms, which was a bonus for me who never felt like having enough towels to use.</p><p>During the second night in Reykjavik, I had my first ever “pod” experience. For some reason I felt an odd sense of security when trapped inside a small but comfy space, like I had really felt safe before. I also didn’t expect my own TV inside this tiny pod. However, the shared bathroom was no comparison to Geysir Hestar. It was small and wet and… smelled like effing lamb!</p><h3 id="Places-to-Go"><a href="#Places-to-Go" class="headerlink" title="Places to Go"></a>Places to Go</h3><h5 id="Silfra-Snorkling-★★★★"><a href="#Silfra-Snorkling-★★★★" class="headerlink" title="Silfra Snorkling ★★★★"></a>Silfra Snorkling ★★★★</h5><p><em>“Silfra is a rift formed in the divergent tectonic <strong>boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates</strong> and is located in the Þingvallavatn Lake in the Þingvellir National Park in Iceland.” –Wikipedia</em></p><p>I picked this tour for my general interst in geological landmarks, but really didn’t expect to experience anything else other than seeing a big boring crack underwater. It turned out quite the otherwise - even dressing and undressing the drysuit was refreshing, not to say that the big crack was blue, beautiful and mysterious.</p><p>The tour was operated by <a href="https://adventurevikings.is/tours/snorkeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure Vikings</a> and started at 12pm. They provided drysuits that could be worn outside of your jeans and shirts to keep you and your own clothes warm and dry, but it took about half an hour and the help of the two guides to fully dress them. Look at me in my drysuit and you’ll get the picture…</p><p><img src="/images/iceland-drysuit.jpg" alt="Drysuit"></p><p>After the whole team got dressed, we walked to the starting point of the snorkel. The whole tour was divided into groups of 5, and being in the last group, I had to wait for another more than half an hour to actually start snorkeling.</p><p>Not sure whether it was about the gears or about the water or just about myself… but the snorkling gears was not working well for me, because the water kept running into my mouth. Changing into another set of gears didn’t work. I could have sworn I snorkled countless times in Australia and Ecuador and never had this problem. The guide of my team was super nice, though. Basically grabbed my wrist and took me places during the entire snorkle.</p><p>The actual time that each person on the tour spent underwater was less than 30 minutes😂 Given that, along with that I was fighting with my gears, I didn’t enjoy the experience as people probably should. Still, I would say the tour was entirely worth the money… Everything underwater seemed glowing in the diamond blue, and I was almost convinced that if I dive deeper, I would see the palace the Little Mermaid lived in, or at least a box of treasure. It was just stunning.</p><p><img src="/images/silfra.jpg" alt="Silfra"></p><h5 id="Þingvellir-National-Park-★★★"><a href="#Þingvellir-National-Park-★★★" class="headerlink" title="Þingvellir National Park ★★★"></a>Þingvellir National Park ★★★</h5><p>So this is where you see the boundary of the two tectonic plates. The hikes were easy and the paved trails were filled with tourists, including a bunch of Chinese aunties who took pictures with colorful scarves…</p><p>For me, the most I could say about this journey was “well… ok” probably because it was foggy and rainy. I was surprised, afterwards, that I have taken my best shot here…</p><p><img src="/images/iceland02.jpg" alt="Þingvellir National Park"></p><h5 id="The-Great-Geysir-★★★☆"><a href="#The-Great-Geysir-★★★☆" class="headerlink" title="The Great Geysir ★★★☆"></a>The Great Geysir ★★★☆</h5><p>This is where a picture worths a thousand words. I can’t really say much about the experience, since it’s just walking around the geysirs and the steam from geothermal heat. Nevertheless, this is exactly the kind of place where I want photos to be taken, especially when in dusk. For some reasons, the rich and creamy colors reminded me of “Alice in Wonderland”…</p><p><img src="/images/iceland03.jpg" alt="Geysir"></p><p>I would say that this place, actually the whole golden circle, quite resembled Yellow Stone National Park. Anyone loves geology and geothermal phenomenon may enjoy it.</p><h5 id="Gulfoss-★★★"><a href="#Gulfoss-★★★" class="headerlink" title="Gulfoss ★★★"></a>Gulfoss ★★★</h5><p>Gulfoss was only ten minutes away from the Great Geysir, but the sign at the intersection was ambiguous so I took another ten minute detour. To whoever going there - when there’s an intersection, turn right.</p><p>The waterfall itself was quite impressive. It was almost like a minified version of the Niagara Falls, but with much more layers and structure. Like the Niagara, there’s a high chance that you would see a huuuuuuge rainbow there…</p><p><img src="/images/iceland-rainbow.jpg" alt="Gulfoss"></p><h5 id="Secret-Lagoon-★★☆"><a href="#Secret-Lagoon-★★☆" class="headerlink" title="Secret Lagoon ★★☆"></a>Secret Lagoon ★★☆</h5><p>Expecting the “Blue Lagoon” to be a pricey tourist trap but wanting something similar anyways, I checked out the <a href="https://secretlagoon.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secret Lagoon.</a> The prospect of experiencing geothermal heat first hand was definitely inviting; The thing was that I was looking for more like a spa than a swimming pool, and unfortunately this secret lagoon was just a heated swimming pool. I was hoping to just find somewhere to sit down for an hour with my body soaked in hot running water, and instead I had to move around and around. As someone who never enjoyed swimming, I started feeling tired and bored after about 15 minutes. The scenery was quite nice though, the same color and texture and creaminess of the Geysir.</p><p><img src="/images/secret-lagoon.jpg" alt="Secret Lagoon"></p><p>The best part of this experience was drinking MountainDew inside the pool. (I was more in the mood for a beer, but I had to drive afterwards…) <em>“The hot and the cold are both so intense, put them together it just makes sense!”</em></p><h5 id="Geothermal-Park-★"><a href="#Geothermal-Park-★" class="headerlink" title="Geothermal Park ★"></a>Geothermal Park ★</h5><p>Half an hour drive from the Geysirs and was said to take only an hour, I went here to kill some time before “Inside the Volcano.” Highlights of this place were making your own egg in the hot springs, and eating cakes baked using geothermal heat…</p><p>And that’s really about it. The whole park was smaller than my office, and the guy at the front desk was not helpful at all. I did get the feeling when I ask him questions that he believed I was an idiot for having to ask him. It was true that everything was in the brochure he gave me, but seriously, who would understand the ambiguous wording?</p><h5 id="Inside-the-Volcano-★★★"><a href="#Inside-the-Volcano-★★★" class="headerlink" title="Inside the Volcano ★★★"></a>Inside the Volcano ★★★</h5><p>In June, I booked this hell expensive <a href="https://insidethevolcano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside the Volcano</a> experience because, well, I just liked Volcano. I immensely enjoyed the experience - The drive there was spectacular, getting onto that small cable car and going through the hole in the volcano was exciting, and I hadn’t hiked for a long time. Whether it was worth $350, though, was another question.</p><p>We meet up at the meeting point, attended the safety lecture and walked about half an hour to the base camp. There we were divided into four groups, and each group would take turns to spend 30 minutes down in the volcano, while the others wait at the base camp. After your turn, you would return to the base camp to wait for groups going after you and… have lamp soup. Ugh.</p><p>So the inside of a volcano looks something like… this.</p><p><img src="/images/inside-the-volcano.JPG" alt="Inside the Volcano"></p><p>(The rectangular light was a cable car; I came in using that.)</p><p>They said that this crate was big enough to hold the Statue of Liberty, and once I got to the bottom and looked up, I was slightly struck by how deep in the hole I was. However, same as touring the Statue of Liberty, there really wasn’t that much to see other than acknowledging to myself that “ok I’ve been here.” Now what? The volcanic rocks didn’t really look different from the inside than from the outside.</p><p>The best part of this experience was talking to our tour guide and learning all about volcanoes in Iceland. So I learnt that there are two types of volcanoes, one formed by explicit eruptions and the other formed by eruptions underneath a glacier (so it never explicitly erupted.) The volcanoes that explicitly erupted may have a big crater inside it, given that the lava has been thrown out by the eruptino. The other kind of volcanos does not have a crater, since during its eruption, the lava would cool down immediately upon meeting the thick ice above. Only after eras would the glacier melt, revealing the volcano underneath. I had never really imagined that volcanoes and glaciers could co-exist; the nature is so miraculous that I am always caught in suprises like this, and this definitely won’t be the last one.</p><h5 id="Snaefellsnes-Peninsula-★★★★☆"><a href="#Snaefellsnes-Peninsula-★★★★☆" class="headerlink" title="Snæfellsnes Peninsula ★★★★☆"></a>Snæfellsnes Peninsula ★★★★☆</h5><p>The primary reason why I chose to go here was only because I could do a one-day trip to and from Reykjavik, and that I had seen wonderful pictures of this place. Now I’m actually regretting making it a one-day trip. I should have spent the whole day there, not just half a day and spent the other half on the road, so I could have gone on some actual hikes.</p><p>The volcano of Snæfellsjökull could be seen from a great distance. One hour drive from Reykjavik and I already got a full blast of it, and it took another two hours driving towards it for me to get to the visitor center. It took me quite a while to find the visitor center because the cellular network reception was awful on the peninsula. I had to drive out of the National Park to a nearby village, search for “Gestastofa Visitor Center,” and go back in again.</p><p>Given the time constraint, the best I could do was to drive to one place, get out of the car, walk a few minutes to take pictures, and get back into the car for the next. Still, the view took me by surprise. I knew it would be breathtaking anyways, but I was expecting some red and black rock underneath the snowy top, and it turned out colorful, rich and creamy. Pink and yellow flowers and bright green grasses expanded beneath the mountain, livestocks wandered lazily on the grass, and occasionally I saw flocks of puffins flying past me. It was totally incredible that this looked exactly the same as Tibet in my imagination. I felt totally in heaven.</p><p><img src="/images/snæfellsnes.jpg" alt="Snæfellsnes"></p><p>At 7:30pm, I arrived at “Kirkjufell” where a scene from Game of Throne had taken place, and made the iconic photo of Snæfellsnes Peninsula for its perfect photo composition. I was hoping to have my tripod with me - capturing the waterfall with slow shutter speed was so hard without it.</p><p><img src="/images/iceland01.jpg" alt="Kirkjufell"></p><h3 id="Budget"><a href="#Budget" class="headerlink" title="Budget"></a>Budget</h3><p>I exchanged $50 cash for about 7,000 Icelandic Kronas at the bank at the airport, and probably spent around 1,000 at the end of the trip, mainly for postcards. I actually got the feeling that credit cards were more widely accepted in Iceland than in the States…</p><p>Regardless of cash usage, this was no doubt the most expensive trip I had ever taken in terms of cost per day. Rough estimate in US dollars,</p><ul><li>Flight $930</li><li>Accomodation $150</li><li>Dining $60</li><li>Car rental $230</li><li>Gas $90</li><li>Silfra Snorkling $135</li><li>Inside the Volcano: $350</li><li>Secret Lagoon: $25</li></ul><p>At this stage of my life, spending $2,000 in three days is kinda scary. I know it’s worth it, but I hope it doesn’t loosen my budget control for future trips😂</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今年一月份就决定Memorial day来Zion打卡一下传说中的Narrows，也想顺便试下看能不能抽中The Wave的抽签，于是早早买了去Vegas的机票（因为便宜）定了行程，四月底找齐驴友定好酒店，然后5.25就出发了。行程如下——</p><ul><li>5/25 - 太平洋时间9:30pm在Vegas降落，出机舱提车又绕去机场附近的in-n-out吃了顿饭，大概11点多从Vegas出发，山地时间夜里3点左右到Kanab, UT的酒店——Canyon Boutique Hotel（强烈推荐，下面会专门讲）然后几天一直住在这，没换过酒店。</li><li>5/26 - Wave抽签没中，去Page, AZ玩了羚羊谷马蹄湾鲍威尔湖，都是风光摄影胜地啊。</li><li>5/27 - Wave再次没抽中，而且Bryce在下雪Zion的一大堆线路（包括narrows)都没开，于是开车两小时到Escalante的<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/zebra-and-tunnel-slots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zebra Slot</a>徒步，回程路上去Bryce的Sunrise Pt看了一眼日落。</li><li>5/28 - Zion来回，打卡了Watchman Trail和<a href="https://www.earthtrekkers.com/hiking-angels-landing-zion-survival-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angel’s Landing</a>.</li><li>5/29 - 山地时间9:00am从Kanab出发，太平洋时间11:30pm到LAS上飞机。</li></ul><p><img src="/images/utah2019-map.png" alt="Map"></p><h3 id="衣食"><a href="#衣食" class="headerlink" title="衣食"></a>衣食</h3><p>虽说每天的目的地从Kanab出发都只有一个半小时左右，但是天气却差非常多！</p><ul><li>Vegas炎炎夏日，最高温高达<strong>30摄氏度</strong>……</li><li>Page虽然距离上离Vegas最远，但是气温气候都差不多</li><li>Kanab和Zion都算正常，10度左右的秋天气温</li><li>Bryce就非常牛逼了，最低温零下，我们去的时候还在下雪❄️……</li></ul><p>于是我的行头大概是，穿着一套夏装上的飞机，然后带了两套夏装两套秋装。长袖衬衣加上我的毛背心和冲锋衣，零度左右只要一直在运动，勉强还hold得住……</p><h3 id="住"><a href="#住" class="headerlink" title="住"></a>住</h3><p>其实我算是临时才决定住在Kanab的，现在发现这个决策真是不要太正确。除了每天早上可以来抽Wave的签以外，它算是在周围一大片好玩的国家公园的中心——</p><ul><li>离Grand Canyon ~1.5h</li><li>离Bryce NP &lt;1.5h</li><li>离Page &lt;1.5h</li><li>离Zion 1h</li></ul><p>可以连续好几天不用换酒店不说，关键是行程可以做的特别灵活。原定的地方如果下雨下雪什么的，分分钟可以上B计划，不仅时间不会被浪费，还很有种不定行程(?)说走就走兴奋感！</p><p>酒店这次住的是Canyon Boutique Hotel的Penthouse Suite，房型非常适合我们这种又有情侣又有闺蜜又有网友的奇怪组合😂两个卧室，客厅有个沙发床，然后一个半浴室刚好在两个卧室中间于是可以互不打扰。价格每晚含税不到400刀（摊到每个人就才不到100……）还包早餐，真是实惠的想哭。房间很干净，沙发床也足够舒服，就是晚上有点冷，需要多和前台要两床被子……</p><h3 id="行"><a href="#行" class="headerlink" title="行"></a>行</h3><p>我不是第一次去这几个地方了，而且有四个月的时间准备行程。然而我是临走当天才意识到——<strong>在两州边界试探，在时间上是会非常混乱的！</strong></p><p>Utah过的是山地时间，然而它南边的Arizona过的是太平洋时间，所以去AZ各种地方计算通勤时间都相当麻烦——比如羚羊谷，我们定的11:40的团，想的是开车过去一个多小时就10点出发呗。我临时才意识到最好等11点再出发，因为路上会多送一个小时。</p><p>更混乱的是，从Kanab去Page走的那条路又基本上和边界平行，所以进入AZ时谷歌地图是不会提示的。到了Page以后，因为Page离边界又太近，所以有些手机并不会自动调整时区（估计手机连的还是Utah的基站……）。我的就没有，导致在5.26那天我基本上随时都在和周围人确认“现在到底是太平洋时间几点”😂</p><p>另一个我没算到的是我们从Vegas到酒店的路上也要调整一次时区，所以之前计划的是9点半降落，10点半左右出机场提车，夜里两点左右到。到了当年我都上飞机了才意识到，事实上我们得当地时间夜里3点才能入住，非常疯狂……（此处给靠谱驴友长途打call！开三个半小时夜车这种事……反正我做不到，佩服到想哭）</p><p>如果说有个什么好处的话就是回Vegas坐飞机的路上算是赚回了一个小时。中午一点的飞机，头两天又运动量巨大。本来以为要早上七八点就起床的，当临走前一天我意识到我们其实可以在床上多睡一个小时的时候我真的是，如释重负啊。</p><p>这次租的车是一辆红色的Nissan Sentra，居然还没有牌照。开起来感觉还不错，油门和刹车都非常灵敏，就是车身好像真的很轻，速度一上80就会觉得车好像轻飘飘的。耗油量我觉得还行，差不多800迈的路程耗了不到两箱油。这车自带car play，不过总觉得看car play的导航有点别扭，一旦注意力放在导航上就完全没有余地看路面。我自己也带了车载支架，但是这辆车驾驶座的充电口在右手边的存储箱里，而在控制盘完全没地方充电，我的充电线又不够长，只能作罢。</p><p><img src="/images/sentra.jpg" alt="Nissan Sentra"></p><p>行程安排我觉得总体还不错，够紧凑但又没有很赶时间。虽然每个景区我们都算是掉过坑，不过到最后也没有太影响我们的兴致。唯一美中不足的就是天气真的不够好，不过这也不是我们能控制的了的了。</p><h4 id="Wave抽签"><a href="#Wave抽签" class="headerlink" title="Wave抽签"></a>Wave抽签</h4><p>每天早上8:30～9:00这个区间，都可以去BLM Kanab Visitor Center去争取第二天去The Wave的资格。现场抽的名额总共有10个，我们一行人这一趟连着抽了两次，虽然都没中，但是也可以介绍一下经验了。</p><p>首先，每组人只用派一个人去抽签现场就行，人多了反而因为太挤还不让全都进去。要在9点之前填好报名表交给主持的两位小哥，所以建议最晚在8:55到现场去填表了。</p><p>到了9点，会议室只剩每个组的代表人了，两位主持会先说一下当天有多少人/多少组报名，然后开始点名并给每个人编号（轮到我的时候就是 “Huang from New York!” “Here!” “Number 46!”）</p><p>等每个人听到自己的号后，这俩人就开始讲安全须知，第二天天气预报，然后就是各种类似赛前动员大会的鸡血内容，什么激不激动兴不兴奋啊，大家来了即使没抽到也是人生赢家啊之类的，最搞笑的是还会让一屋子几十个人真的玩一波human wave…</p><p>真正抽签的时候，竟然真的是把四十多个小圆球扔到一个有手摇装置的滚筒里，跟摇六合彩一样摇上好几圈，特别喜感。我们去抽的两天，第一天总共118人，被分成49组。被抽中的头两组都是4人组，最后一组也超过了两个人，需要代表从组里选两个人出来了。第二天是另外一位驴友代表去抽的，听说总共45组，最后选了5对人出来……</p><h4 id="Page-AZ"><a href="#Page-AZ" class="headerlink" title="Page, AZ"></a>Page, AZ</h4><p>这是我第三次去Page了。快到中午了开车过去，从中午到傍晚总共玩了四个地方：羚羊谷X，Glen Canyon Dam Overlook, 鲍威尔湖和马蹄湾。理论上Page这几个地方的玩法都是坐车到各种观景台拍拍拍模式，因为大中午的自然光遇到峡谷地貌会有种神奇而无法描述的灯光效果，所以这里对于风光摄影狗来说绝对是天堂，不过对于其他人来说也就那么回事了。</p><p><strong>羚羊谷X：</strong>定的中午11:40的团，比上下羚羊谷要更宽敞，人也更少。不过从摄影的角度来说，线条和打光确实没有上下羚羊谷要精致。尤其是抛沙子那波操作，在上下羚羊谷导游都会给游客解释清楚，到了这儿就变得……匪夷所思……没按快门呢先被扬起来的沙子迷了一眼睛😂</p><p><strong>格伦峡谷大坝：</strong>是个观景点吧，意外的很好看，除了河水没有弯成马桶圈形状以外，颜色和结构都和马蹄湾非常像，甚至水色还更碧绿更好看。唯一让人觉得有点无语的是我又在这儿碰到了穿廉价汉服拍照的女生……简直</p><p><strong>鲍威尔湖：</strong>其实是个人工水库，但是倒映着红色的丹霞地貌就特别美，所以也是个热门拍照点了。16年春天想玩鲍威尔湖结果一直没找到位置，这次倒是找到地方了，结果悲催的发现这个地方是必须提前攻略，不方便说走就走。基本上想去玩的话，地点应该定位到<em>“Wahweap Marina”</em>。<br>到了Wahweap港口以后可以定boat tour，不过临时能给的选择很有限。也可以提前在Page整个城市找找有没有鲍威尔湖的kayak tour，一般大概70～80刀，但是一定要提早订，当天下午肯定是订不到的了。最后我们一群人就很无聊地在港口附近走走拍拍，风景倒是真的不错，不过除了看风景也确实没什么别的活动了。</p><p>这里来点干货——<a href="https://www.lakepowell.com/things-to-do/boat-tours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click me for boat tours at Wahweap Marina!</a></p><p><img src="/images/lake-powell.jpg" alt="Lake Powell"></p><p><strong>马蹄湾：</strong>之前去了两次都错过了日出，所以这次想去看日落来着，结果可能因为所有人都是这么想的……停车场意外的难进。我们在马蹄湾入口那条路堵了半个小时的车，终于进停车场以后发现天气状况也不够理想。夕阳是看不到了，同时风实在太大，一旦迎着风，就会被一大片粗粒的红沙子打的皮肤生疼。我们不敢睁眼睛也不敢睁嘴，生怕漏一个缝，就会有一大片沙粒倒进来。</p><p>这晚的云彩发自真心太惊艳了！马蹄湾基本都没拍好，但是感觉这一趟拍云彩倒是出了大片，果然柳暗花明又一村，只要擦亮眼睛，哪里都能看到风景啊。</p><p><img src="/images/horseshoe.jpg" alt="Horseshoe Bend Clouds"></p><h4 id="Zebra-Slot-Canyon"><a href="#Zebra-Slot-Canyon" class="headerlink" title="Zebra Slot Canyon"></a>Zebra Slot Canyon</h4><p>意外发现的一条人少（我们去程一个人都没见到），风景非常好，且有很多探索可能步道。从Kanab开过去两个半小时，不算很近但也还可以接受。</p><p>入口不难找，直接在谷歌地图上搜索”Zebra Slot Canyon Trailhead”，入口对面就是个大停车场。只是来这个trailhead要从12号公路转到一条叫Hole in the Rock Rd的小泥路，总共要开5英里，尤其是下雨天非常难开，轮子要不然就打滑要不然就左右乱撞。那会儿我真的很后悔自己没有租四驱车或者SUV，再次给驴友大神脱帽打call</p><p>一路上风景都是还蛮典型的犹他州红色丹霞地貌，每当转过一个转角都会有种豁然开朗的大气感。比较有意思的是两旁的红墙上经常动不动冒出来个洞，我们也不知道是怎么形成的。不过我们去了其中一两个洞口探险来着，其中一个里面好像住了老鼠……</p><p>一路上有些地方需要蹚深到脚踝的水。第一次过河的时候大家基本上都把鞋脱了过的河，然后坐在河岸花了好长时间擦脚。好不容易擦完脚穿上鞋袜，发现后面的路还要过河（其实是我们走错了）这下我才发现对我们四个人的脑洞有了充分的了解——我们其中两位同学带了几个垃圾袋上路，到河边的时候还剩6个。我开玩笑提出“大家可以钻到垃圾袋里跳过河去”，没想到另外三个人竟然觉得这个主意不错。这时其中一个户外大神提出可以找一个人用两个垃圾袋（每条腿各一个），另外三个人再轮流用剩下两个袋子，由第一个人两岸来回送……我从小学奥数，做过太多“过河问题”，第一次真的见证这种问题实际发生了，在岸上笑的快死了。</p><p><img src="/images/zebra-slot.JPG" alt="Zebra Slot Canyon"></p><p>如果说这条步道有什么不好的，就是路比较难认，对于我们这些直觉不灵敏的新手来讲有些不友好。本来应该是个全长6英里的环形路线，中间有一个小分支可以去Zebra Slot Canyon内部的。然而我们去的那天下雨，在入口碰到出来的人和我们说可能里面会有淹到胸口的水。加上BLM管理的步道本身标记就做的不太好，我们走到后来有点迷路。后来虽然也知道自己回到正确的路上了，但是为了避免之后再走错导致天黑出不去，或者碰到水位太高的地方，我们最终走到3 miles多，上了一个小山包的山顶，然后就直接原路返回了。这里感谢户外大神的强势carry，要不然我自己真的完全不认路啊！</p><h4 id="Bryce-Canyon-National-Park-–-Sunrise-Point"><a href="#Bryce-Canyon-National-Park-–-Sunrise-Point" class="headerlink" title="Bryce Canyon National Park – Sunrise Point"></a>Bryce Canyon National Park – Sunrise Point</h4><p>很可惜，Bryce最有名的步道Navajo loop trail关门了，所以风景最好的Sunset Point也就没有了去的必要。但是Sunrise Point的Queens Garden Trail还开着，于是我们从Zebra Slot Canyon出来便直奔Sunrise Point了。很爽的一点是可能因为纬度高，Bryce日落特别晚，大概当地时间八点半。因此，虽然我们六点半左右才走出Zebra Slot Canyon，而且路上又花了差不多一个半小时，我们依然赶上了看日落最佳时间。</p><p>更让我惊喜的是老天爷竟然赏我白日梦成真一次。白天我们去Zebra Slot路过Bryce的时候大雪纷飞，能见度可能可能只有几十米。我那时候说，最好到了下午，雪还没化，天又晴了，于是可以看黄昏雪景……</p><p>我真的没想到，竟然被我说中了。我们开进Bryce甚至拐弯进入Sunrise Point停车场的时候大雪还没停，结果下了车往观景台走的时候眼睁睁的看着天就这么放晴了，于是拍出了这几天最棒的片子。</p><p>只是因为雪刚停，天依然还是很冷很冷很冷。我本来是想好好在步道上走上它一个小时的，结果大家都hold不住这个天气，于是就赶快爬回车上取暖了。</p><p><img src="/images/bryce.jpg" alt="Bryce Canyon"></p><h4 id="Zion-National-Park-–-Angel’s-Landing"><a href="#Zion-National-Park-–-Angel’s-Landing" class="headerlink" title="Zion National Park – Angel’s Landing"></a>Zion National Park – Angel’s Landing</h4><p>冲着Narrows来的，结果因为化雪Narrows封路了——于是Zion算是成了这一趟我最失望的景区😂</p><p>首先，我们进大门的时候大概花了半个小时排队。<br><img src="/images/zion-entrance.jpg" alt="Zion Entrance"></p><p>到了停车场，绕了两大圈大概20分钟，都没找到停车位，只好出去到Springdale镇上找。离Springdale出口比较近的几个停车场也都没有车位了，正当我们还在某个停车场里绕圈的时候……马路对面那家Subway的大叔喊住了我们，收了我们15刀，让我们在他家停车场的1-hour parking停一整天😂看到这种骚操作，几个小伙伴们纷纷表示，感觉怎么好像国内的景点！我回想了一下，Zion和华山确实非常相像，都是很白很陡峭，都以“险”著称，甚至Angel’s Landing和长空栈道也可以对应的上……（上次去华山没走长空栈道还是觉得有点可惜，捂脸）</p><p>在Zion的门口的户外装备店等小伙伴们上厕所/买东西的时候，我问了一下店员里面的情况，得知——基本上比较好玩的步道，narrows, kayenta trail, upper emerald trail, observation point什么的，全都关了。唯一一个难度在线还没关的路线就是Angel’s landing，但是由于这条线路里面有很多个点一次是只能过一个人，而近期又是公众假期其他线路又关的差不多了，于是这条道可能要排队一个小时以上……</p><p>于是我们先去走了剩下的路线里面据说难度最高的<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/the-watchman-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watchman Trail</a>，就在游客中心附近。两个小时走完全程，人很多，难度……嗯，比莲花山还是更难爬的，可能更接近笔架山，纯靠体力，完全不用动脑。很明显，没有一个人觉得够给力的。</p><p>从Watchman Trail下来以后回游客中心喝水上厕所，我决定再问一下专家们有没有线路可以走。排了几分钟队，终于站到了一个萌萌哒小姐姐面前。小姐姐听完了我的需求（有没有比Watchman Trail更烧脑的路可以走啊！？）以后，热情地给我推荐了……Angel’s Landing.</p><p>“现在快下午三点了对吧，人基本上都走了，你刚好赶最后一波，时间正好！快去啊再不去就晚了！”</p><p>我被她热情的安利冲昏了头脑，加上另外三个小伙伴也确实都没去过Angel’s Landing，于是就秒速把他们拉上了Zion的接驳车，朝着Angel’s Landing进发了。过了大概一个多小时，我终于站在了铁链的起点。爬到第一段完全没链子抓的部分我就开始抓狂了——我是谁，我在哪，我为什么在这里——最重要的问题是，我上次是是是怎么爬下来的……</p><p>用屁股大概蹭到中间一段的时候，天上下起了毛毛雨。其中一个小伙伴表示安全起见还是打道回府吧，这万一再往前爬，雨下大了可能就回不来了。看到有小伙伴做了表率，我终于没有了一定要装逼的压力，加上以前也确实打卡过全程了，于是我愉快地跟着打道回府了。往回走的过程中多少有点不甘心，但现在想想觉得自己反正啥也没错过……</p><p>虽说对我而言这一小段算是白爬了，不过也算是证明了前台热情的小姐姐说的是对的——3点钟出发4点多开始爬，虽然不能说人很少，但是确实不算多。所谓“排队一小时”什么的，我是完全没看到的。</p><h3 id="Misc"><a href="#Misc" class="headerlink" title="Misc."></a>Misc.</h3><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title="$$$"></a>$$$</h4><p>算一下这次的花销——</p><p>机票是1月底就买好的，含保险总共才 $250</p><p>然后……Splitwise真心是个好东西，不仅是分账容易了很多，回来以后还能特别直观看明细，比存一堆收据方便多了。</p><p>酒店 $1192.87 / 4 = $298.22 （这是四晚上，每人每晚75）<br>租车 $342.75 / 4 = $85.69<br>羚羊X $63.45<br>零食和水 $35.1 / 4 = $8.8<br>各类停车费 $25 / 4 = $6.25<br>油钱 $111.49 / 4 = $27.87 （我一般加油都会选最贵那个，捂脸）<br>饭钱我们一般各付各的，所以没啥记录，平均一顿 $20左右，不过总共我们只吃了4顿</p><p>也就是除了机票以外总共开销才$400左右，我觉得还算是挺便宜的了！</p><h4 id="👭👬"><a href="#👭👬" class="headerlink" title="👭👬"></a>👭👬</h4><p>这次一起出来玩的几位驴友都超级给力，我可以毫不犹豫地说在我一起玩过的所有旅途里面可以排前三。不仅有户外大神和开夜车大神/风光大神这两位男童鞋的实力carry，还非常有纪念意义——来美国后说了这么多年要和H童鞋一起出来玩，这次终于终于实现了！</p><p>不过什么硬实力啊还有友情加成都不是最重要的，最重要的还是我们这拨人脑洞好像都很大！和脑洞大的人一起玩，往往会感受到意想不到的欢乐！</p><p>当然把驴友们夸上天以后我也是要给自己挽个尊的，能够让大家玩的都这么开心，我自己得力的计划和组织也是功不可没的咳咳</p>]]></content>

extension，我感恩节回公司以后就发邮件问了问情况。</p><p>一天后收到回信——“Blanket没音儿了，你赶快办个individual petition吧。”</p><p>这两个有什么区别呢？Blanket petition是公司一办办一堆，一旦办下来了，我就不用给移民局交材料了。</p><p>Individual则不同，律师和HR要根据每个人的情况准备材料，然后送到移民局审批……也就是说，如果移民局审批速度不够快的话，我不一定赶得上2.22的飞机。事实证明最后确实没赶上。</p><h4 id="2018-12"><a href="#2018-12" class="headerlink" title="2018.12"></a>2018.12</h4><p>月初，律师最后问了我一次我当时的年薪和公司地址，我也给她了。后来不知道在忙什么，整个月都没有和她再联系。现在想来挺后悔的，那会儿我怎么就忘了多催催她呢。</p><h4 id="2019-1月初"><a href="#2019-1月初" class="headerlink" title="2019.1月初"></a>2019.1月初</h4><p><strong>1月2日。</strong>新年一过完，我就给律所发了邮件问进度，结果……材料竟然还没寄出去。“你老板昨儿刚在你材料上签好名，现在在公司HR那儿，等他们也签好名了再给我，我再整合好寄给移民局。”</p><p>我一看时间赶不及了，赶快给她说我要上premium processing，并且麻溜儿从波多黎各寄了张支票去费城的律所。</p><p>一周后律师收到支票，发现……我在支票上没写日期😂</p><p>我去年买了个表……</p><p>于是我紧急联系菜师傅，叫他从Virginia给我往费城寄了一张支票。</p><p>两天后律师收到支票。<strong>1月11日，</strong>律师终于整理好我全部资料，寄到了德州的移民局。</p><h3

id="2019-2"><a href="#2019-2" class="headerlink" title="2019.2"></a>2019.2</h4><p><strong>1月28日。</strong>律所给我发了个邮件，大概让我提供我工作中用到的各种材料。总共分八大类，每大类里面有分四五个小类，每一类我都得提供至少两份材料还有对材料的语言描述。看到这个东西我感觉特别头大，感觉就和上学时候要写paper一样，看到就头痛，只想努力往死线拖拖拖。但我也知道在这件事上只能靠我自己自觉，毕竟我参不参加婚礼和我的老板和律师一点关系都没有，真的去不了的话整个公司也就只有我一个人会伤心。</p><p>硬着头皮花了半天把材料都整理出来发了过去，结果老板跟我说“你这些training materials的深度不够啊，你需要证明我公司再从外面招人，招不到一个你这样的。”于是我一咬牙，花了一两个小时，直接把整个公司的文档库打了个包下载下来，当自己的training materials用了。</p><p><strong>1月30日，</strong>我们终于把这一大堆资料发给了律师。然后律师回复我们，想问我们要产品源代码，还有和客户的合同之类的。</p><p>于是我老板和公司HR又为这事儿折腾了一周，当然这个过程中我是没办法掺和的，只能着急的干等。一周后的<strong>2月6号</strong>，我公司这边终于把相关信息整理好提供给了律所。</p><p><strong>2月8日。</strong>律师又发邮件来了，问我要我在纽约的组和北京的组所有组员的……job description和简历？不是，我哪里能搞到所有人的简历啊……？纽约的组还好说（只有8个人）我在北京那个组60多个人呢，而且我那会儿的顶头上司老早就离职了好嘛……</p><p>关键是律师的邮件里还写的不清不楚的，有个地方还写错了，搞得我和我老板都以为只用提供纽约的组员信息就行。</p><p><strong>2月12日</strong>。律所又跑来问我要我在美国和国内的工资条和近三年的税单（之前为什么没来找我要啊！？）同时律所也把起草好的RFE response letter发给了我和我老板，让我们查漏补缺，里面空出来了不少地方让我们填，我们大概花了两三天也都补好了。</p><p><strong>2月22日</strong>。</p><p>还有！跟我们说，我在国内的组的组员信息也要我提供一份……</p><p>应该说这些任务都不算很难，但是折腾了一个月的我，到了这个节骨眼儿上，已经完全无法忍受接着写这个RFE大作文的过程了。每次看到律师找我要不管什么东西，我都觉得，头痛，头痛，真的好头痛……感觉和上学的时候熬夜做一个完全不会做的作业真的一模一样。</p><p>都到了这个时候，我是彻底不可能如期回国了。于是我和律师确认了一下，发现只要公司愿意放人，我也可以在petition被批准之前回国，然后在国内等着petition被批准再去签证。知道这个消息的我算是终于看到了一线希望，觉得我终于可以回去参加婚礼了，于是把机票改到了3.8日到4月底（之前提到过还有一帮小伙伴3.7-3.17来纽约，最后只有3.7晚上见到了两个）。那会儿我并没有想到，之后的两个月，我真的一直在担心会不会丢饭碗……</p><p>也就是这段时间，我心情的起伏特别严重，感觉情绪的波动已经完全超出了自己能够控制的范围。基本上，只要收到律所发邮件给我要东西，我就会有想哭想喝醉的冲动；但只要我把什么东西给律所寄了回去，我就会有种，终于……如释重负的轻松感，就想找个地方暴饮暴食。</p><p><strong>2月26日</strong></p><p>终于把北京组员的名单和学历也都写好上交了（北京这么多人我其实真的不知道谁是什么学历的，一个个查linkedin之类的真的好累啊……）这时候律师又一球打回来——你们写的job description每个人只有一句话啊，太简单了，能不能给个详细点的？</p><p>我这会儿都已经疯了——这特么什么时候才算完啊！好在老板是经验丰富的老司机，直接给了我个公司HR的人名，让我找这个人要一份招聘广告，截取了里面的job description就可以发给律师了。</p><p>结果公司招聘部门的人也都不是好打发的。老板让我找的那个人大半天没理我，下午跟我说“你去找另一个人”。我找的“另一个人”又跑来问我“你要这个干什么？发给移民局？那你叫律师来找我。”</p><p>总之这事儿又绕了好几圈，我们在<strong>2月28日</strong>才把job description整理出来发了过去。</p><h4 id="2019-3月初"><a href="#2019-3月初" class="headerlink" title="2019.3月初"></a>2019.3月初</h4><p><strong>3月1日，</strong>最终的RFE回复信终于准备完成。由我在纽约的老板 和 在北京的老板的老板（之前提到过我顶头上司离职了所以让他的老板代劳了）都签过名以后，再发给公司HR部门，HR将这些内容在公司信纸上打印出来后，还要将打印件寄给费城的律所。折腾来折腾去，终于，在<strong>3月8日</strong>，我的RFE response和我本人一起从美国东岸出发，它去德州我回国。</p><h3 id="签证阶段"><a href="#签证阶段"

title="2019.4.3"></a>2019.4.3</h4><p>没想到啊没想到，第八次签美国签证的我，竟然在阴沟里翻船了——</p><p>是的，签证预约系统里还留着我2017年填进去的DS160号吗，而我并没有把它改成最新的。于是就在这天，我收到领事馆的邮件，叫我4月4号不用去了，等着重新约吧……</p><p>这一天过的非常长。我可以接受自己蠢自己粗心，但我非常非常害怕要和我老板报备这件事情……要知道petition没批准就跑回国这么大胆的事直接先斩后奏，如果真的丢了饭碗的话我一点都不奇怪。</p><h4 id="2019-4-18"><a href="#2019-4-18" class="headerlink" title="2019.4.18"></a>2019.4.18</h4><p>重新预约的签证是这一天，于是下午去广州面签了。过程还是有些bug，比如说我带过去的照片被领事馆说不合格，让我现场重新拍。还有就是面签完以后让我交$120的签证费，可我并不知道要交这笔钱，只好离开领馆找我妈要了钱，再跑回领馆来拿代表“签证通过”的黄条。不过不管怎么说，至少面签到最后是通过了的。</p><p>我以为这就快结束了，结果这个尾巴拖的比我想象中的长……</p><h4 id="2019-4-29"><a href="#2019-4-29" class="headerlink" title="2019.4.29"></a>2019.4.29</h4><p>签证状态在经过10天的administrative processing以后终于变成了issued. 两天后收到护照，签证有效期给到了2020年年底。</p><p>这10天以来我天天刷一亩三分地，还发现不少“面签通过结果最后被check“的例子的，每看到一个这样的例子我的心里就往下坠一下……</p><p>这个时候我已经花了$250把我回程机票改到了<strong>5月6号。</strong>万幸万幸，如果再晚几天出签的话，我又要再花这么多钱改机票，这不就变成无底洞了么……</p><h3 id="后续"><a href="#后续" class="headerlink" title="后续"></a>后续</h3><p><strong>2019.5.6。</strong>在飞机上看了16小时《逃避可耻但有用》后，我终于成功到达了美国。下了飞机直接被人拉到入境队伍最前面，于是连队都没排。</p><p>然而入境官员填我I-94的时候竟然把我身份写成了L1-A（好像我们公司另外几个和我同期办L1b的都经历过这个）……于是我两天后又专门跑了一趟JFK机场的Deferred Inspection Office改了一次I-94😂</p><p>Anyways，也算过了一把高管的瘾？</p><h3 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h3><p>这个5月过有多忙碌而充实，这之前的几个月就过得有多焦虑而空虚。</p><p>我无心学习无心工作，甚至无心好好玩耍。每天除了弹钢琴解压以外，我觉得我基本上就是在慌乱无措——找到办法——等待其他人的配合——在等待期间感到无比焦虑的恶性循环当中度过度过。</p><p>一开始，觉得有一个很有效的方法就是好好分解自己的焦虑——当您能想通自己为什么焦虑的时候，你慢慢也就不焦虑了。</p><p>到后来觉得这个方法不完全游泳——我知道我焦虑是因为自己不能控制的未知……可是我再努力摆正心态，我还是不能控制这个未知啊！而且只是摆正心态又能怎么样？根本问题不解决，心态再好也只能治标不治本啊。</p><p>所以说，这个问题依然是无解的吧。</p><p>无所谓啦。至少这一切都已经过去了。在我遇到下一次必须和USCIS斗智斗力的情况时，先好好珍惜我这一年想去哪就能去哪的自由吧。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近看了两部过时两三年了的肥皂剧，都是我很不好意思出去跟人说我在看的那种。一个是回程飞机上看的《逃避可耻却有用》（感谢此剧，我在飞机上16小时没睡觉，下飞机到家刚好半夜12点直接躺床，之后基本没有倒时差）还有一部我现在才看了一半儿多……《延禧攻略》😂</p><p>大概感觉就是——为什么别人都说年轻人看肥皂剧小鹿乱撞，老了就老鹿撞不动了呢？我反而觉得我中学甚至大学的时候看肥皂剧里男主撩妹，都能很理智地觉得“这特么好肉麻好假”，而现在每次看就觉得“对我知道这很假而且如果现实中有人和我这样我只会虎躯一震，但是隔着屏幕看就是被撩的小心肝扑通扑通跳啊啊啊啊”</p><h4 id="逃避可耻却有用"><a href="#逃避可耻却有用" class="headerlink" title="逃避可耻却有用"></a>逃避可耻却有用</h4><p>两年前这剧蛮火的时候，我在菜师傅家看了大结局。典型的恋爱肥皂剧，典型的甜软萌女主配扑克脸男主，还有看上去很花其实认真起来不要命的帅比男二，野心勃勃从各方面来讲都似乎比女主优秀的女二，甚至包括契约婚恋的设定，也都是这类肥皂剧的标配。之所以对这部剧一直感兴趣，是觉得“把家庭当公司经营”这个概念挺有趣的。这次香港直飞纽约16个小时，看到飞机上有这部剧，就抱着“随便看看消磨时间”的心态看了起来。</p><p>万万没想到，这么俗套的剧情和人设，居然给了我一种“好看到脱俗”的感觉。如果让我给我看过的肥皂剧排名的话，我觉得我可以给它排第一……看这部剧全程的感觉像是慢慢吃掉一盘我妈炒的青菜——暖胃。最普通的材料最普通的配方，就是能把我的胃收的服服帖帖。</p><p>这部剧主要是在围绕两个问题展开，1.家庭主妇的价值定位 2.如何直面自卑而不是逃避，说具体点就是如何收服一个母胎单身狗让他乖乖和你谈恋爱。两个问题的展开还是很恰到好处的，不会像其他无脑恋爱剧一样看完就忘，但是也确实不用带脑子看，完全不破坏热恋的幼稚感。</p><p>因为我自己对于做家务深恶痛绝（反而很幸运，男朋友和男室友都比我更爱做家务……），所以对于主妇价值定位这个问题没有太多精神上的共鸣，不过总觉得中国应该是不会出这种话题的电视剧了。然而作为一个社交/交友方面自卑感很重的人，我觉得我真是特别特别能理解里面的男主对每件事的反应，虽然可能没体验过社交障碍的人会觉得很神经病……网上有个评论说这男主多半是阿斯伯格吧？看这男主在工作环境中的表现觉得还挺正常的，不过和女生相处起来真的可以说非常阿斯了！</p><p>而gakki酱演的女主是怎么从契约同居契约拥抱这种最简单的事一条条教起，不管对方多没心眼多难撩都能耐心坚持下去。我只能说换我我肯定就半途而废了……所以说社恐朋友们你们看这个剧只能坐坐白日梦，你们确实需要这种春风化雨的妹子认领，问题是我真心觉得现实中的码农圈，是没有gakki酱的啊。</p><p>不过这剧我最磕的cp必须是风见和百合酱！百合酱简直就是我心目中标准的女人赢啊，事业有成气质优雅生活潇洒，关键是50岁还能被30岁的忠犬追追追！！！而且风见也真的非常会撩的啊，首先和百合酱从一开始就给上帝视觉围观群众一种很来电的感觉，后来在桥上一个侧身壁咚（？）我就hold不住了想开始哇哇叫了。后来一个冲口而出“你把我当外甥可我明明是想要你的啊”，怎么说呢如果放在生活中有人对我这么说，我多半觉得这特么就性骚扰。可是看剧的时候觉得怎么就是那么直接那么黄暴那么动人啊！！！</p><h4 id="延禧攻略"><a href="#延禧攻略" class="headerlink" title="延禧攻略"></a>延禧攻略</h4><p>我是真的不想承认我自己在看这么低级的电视剧，可是我真的不仅在看，而且是刷夜看那种，而且上班有时候也看两眼……</p><p>追剧的动力主要是磕傅璎cp。其实我并不是一直以来都萌这对cp的，而且男女主的长相也都不是我的菜（哦男主有某个角度很好看……就那一个角度，其他简直就完全不能看），但是其中有那么一两段真是把我折服了。第一个就是傻白甜傅恒为了证明自己没有杀害女主姐姐，把身上的匕首递给女主那一段我就，糟糕，是心动的感觉啊！而且女主刺完他之后跑了，再下次见面他就表白了，甜到哭！第二次我被这对cp撩到是因为女主太社会了，这一言不合就宽衣解带准备肉偿人情债的操作，至少在这个剧情设定里真心太牛逼了。可是傻白甜真是太傻白甜了，天天给人洗脑要为了一起为了自由婚恋努力，结果自己一碰到困难，也不好好想别的办法就被忽悠去和别的姑娘洞房花烛了。别说女主这个性格了，就连我这种圣母性格都觉得很有点瞧不起他……不过女主那一段的台词还是蛮走心的，那种瞬间天崩地裂的感觉确实戳到我了。后来的卫龙cp其实萌点更多，但是感觉更像是现代的chick lit（男的有很多dates，女的也算是有个备胎），比起“爱情”这种好像很假大空的玩意儿更注重“投缘”。放到生活中的话，我其实会更萌这一类型的情侣，但是看这种无脑电视剧嘛，我可能就还是喜欢看这种假的毫无廉耻但是就是往我泪点上戳的人和事，就当嗑药了。</p><p>话说这剧我越看越觉得是不是于妈抄的还珠格格啊，基本上傅璎cp完全可以对应永燕，然后富察皇后和璎珞这俩差不多一个小燕子一个紫薇（而且性质差不多，不是姐妹的姐妹）。还有不少网友说为啥皇阿玛和令妃为啥那么喜欢小燕子紫薇，对于小燕子扮小太监之类的骚操作都见怪不怪，是因为他们都是过来人哇～</p><p>这个剧里面虽然剧情越来越扯淡，但有看头的人设也不少（是有看头，不是有说服力）。我最喜欢的大概是纯妃姐姐，首先长相是我的菜（萌就是正义！）然后就是一直保持着一种似笑非笑的“嘿嘿我什么都知道我就是不说”的神秘感，而且她在故事前期给我一种感觉就是，明明真的没有在争宠，但是研究起后宫局势来好像总是特别兴奋，一会儿和皇后娘娘讨论讨论，一会儿和娴妃娘娘讨论讨论……总体怎么说呢，就有一种“我就默默看着你们装逼”的上帝视觉感。可惜了后来女主被纳入后宫后，为了成全主角光环，纯贵妃娘娘智商就开始非常明显地掉线了。当然这也可以理解，她自己成了局内人，自然就不能开上帝视觉了……人设最make sense的我觉得还是娴妃娘娘，顺便给佘诗曼打call，所有演员里面演的最有说服力的！（而且勒死嘉嫔那一幕也是真的看得爽……）从头到尾，包括到最后，她并没有对任何无辜的人下手，不是什么以毁掉别人为乐的心理变态或者推动剧情的工具，也比较符合她从小以来的正规家教。比《还珠格格》里的皇后娘娘那种为了剧情不得不无原则无底线的“坏”，要高级多了。</p><p>写完了，发出来以后我接着去看延禧宫略去了……但愿周末能看完，上班追剧真的不好😂</p>]]></content>

      最近看了两部过时两三年了的肥皂剧，都是我很不好意思出去跟人说我在看的那种。一个是回程飞机上看的《逃避可耻却有用》（感谢此剧，我在飞机上16小时没睡觉，下飞机到家刚好半夜12点直接躺床，之后基本没有倒时差）还有一部我现在才看了一半儿多……《延禧攻略》😂

大概感觉就是——为什么别人都说年轻人看肥皂剧小鹿乱撞，老了就老鹿撞不动了呢？我反而觉得我中学甚至大学的时候看肥皂剧里男主撩妹，都能很理智地觉得“这特么好肉麻好假”，而现在每次看就觉得“对我知道这很假而且如果现实中有人和我这样我只会虎躯一震，但是隔着屏幕看就是被撩的小心肝扑通扑通跳啊啊啊啊”

      这一趟回国3.9-5.5，因为签证问题，历时总共两个月。前前后后在深圳呆了4周，加上和家里出去玩了一周。如果没记错的话，我自打大二以来就没和家里人一起呆过那么久了，感觉非常像学生时代放暑假。

心得体会也和暑假差不多——3月的我：啊啊好好吃！啊啊好好玩！！啊啊好久没见！！！啊啊太美啦拍拍拍！！！！4月的我：啊啊好无聊，啊啊好想纽约，啊啊快让我回去上班……




3月份是真的很有意义，无敌充实，趁着两周年假做了很多好几年都没机会做的事情。参加发小婚礼这事对于我而言真的是人生第一次了，然后终于赶上一次宁的生日（上次给他过生日还在高二，整整10年前），赶上了元阳的好天气拍了大片，最后还圆了好几年的

      这是一波迟到了两个月的 #10YearChallenge. 昨天是2019年3月22日。十年前的昨天，我在地铁上过了一遍口语然后再华强北吃了个麦当劳早餐后，怀着紧张雀跃的心情，第一次走进了托福考场。

现在想想，这很可能是我这辈子最难忘的一天。



成绩单上没有名字只有姓。等我考完出来被考官问到此事，我一开始有些一头雾水不知道怎么回事，直到考官和我暗示这个成绩可能不算数。我出了考试那座楼，就在街上开始大哭——也是我懂事之后绝无仅有的体验了。

当时的心情还记得很清楚，两个原因让我特别悲伤。一个是，那之前的两个月，我把自己如此往死里嗑还能坚持下来，完全是为了这一天，而这一天的成绩作废等于是我之

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>自从有了推特和微信朋友圈后，真的越来越少写日记周记随笔了。有点怀念那时候表达欲极强的我，只要双手放到键盘上，不拘内容格式，一定能把想说的话都说个干净。</p><p>而现在呢？只一忽儿，2019年就过了七分之一了。看了书写了字，心情起起伏伏，但好像也并没有一定要记载下来的渴望。写博客的意义变成了“以免日后忘了”或者别的什么，总之目的性越来越强。而十年前的我，写博客好像更多的是为了“写博客”本身。</p><p>那么，随便写写我这个七分之一吧。</p><hr><p>发现了一家很好吃的餐馆，东村的Thursday Kitchen。应该说“好吃的餐馆”在任何城市都不会少，不过会让我觉得“原来菜还可以这么做”的餐厅，我觉得一年下来我能发现的，一只手也就数过来了。</p><p>应该说去年这个时候我就很想吃Thursday Kitchen了，在我的想吃榜里躺了很久。有一次是和H周六下午逛街玩了想去吃，结果一到门口一问说是排队快两个小时（东村嘛）。加上这家餐厅离哪个地铁站都不算很近，所以我竟然拖到今年，一个人在东村没事干的时候才去打了卡。</p><p>这家主打的Kimchi Paella我觉得和Momofuku系列理念比较像，大概就是用东亚的做法做西餐。想起来我第一次吃西班牙海鲜饭时也觉得很惊艳，但一月份在波多黎各海鲜饭吃太多，已然对西班牙口味免疫了。所以说，如果事先跟我说是把泡菜和海鲜饭一起做，我可能能够想象出一个还不错的味道。但这里的泡菜海鲜饭，味道和我想象的相似，但好吃了不是一星半点。这两种从没被联想到一起的食材放到一起，互相好像真的起到了画龙点睛的作用啊。</p><p><img src="https://fastly.4sqi.net/img/general/width960/4130279_dC8XdQh9_nRNHrJ_JOGwNYDwEuVX0hrfGh1eeJF5T8o.jpg" alt="Kimchi Paella"></p><hr><p>去看了几场演出/音乐会，印象最深的是音乐剧《摩门经》和大都会歌剧院的《弄臣》。这一版的弄臣其实我已经是二刷了，但一起的小伙伴虽然对歌剧已经算入门了但是并不知道《弄臣》是讲什么的，看得她非常惊艳。</p><p>我看完了感受比较复杂。总的来说算是一场视听盛宴了，而且Act 1看得我全程合不拢嘴。但是我最喜欢的唱段（Act 3杀手兄妹为了大猪蹄子男主的命运争吵，傻白甜女主为爱敲门送死那段）……在Spotify里听惯了多明戈那版，觉得眼前的表演戏剧张力也太弱了！首先兄妹两个在争吵的时候应该看着对方呀，两个人就那么站着也不做动作对着观众唱歌，感觉浪费了很多表现机会呀。而女主拍门竟然只是做动作，竟然没有把“砰砰砰”那几下拍出来。至少我在听多明戈版本那一段的时候，那三拍敲门，简直就是我的心跳声。太紧张。当然下面乐队的伴奏我觉得还是很给力的。这里分享一下——</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/D8ghwBM2N0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>下一个。《摩门经》我一直知道好看，但我真没想到会是我这一年来看过最喜欢的剧。我之前没有想到它居然这么欢脱。不过这不是重点，重点是，我作为一个对宗教话题相当感兴趣（虽然看不下去相关书籍😂）却从未信过教的人，看这个剧竟然觉得蜜汁治愈。想了很久的“人为什么要信教”，也从这个剧中找到了一个比较有说服力的答案。后来我听说这个剧在盐湖城演的时候还有很多真摩门教的人们出来卖萌，我不禁有些好奇这个剧作家是不是任何宗教的教徒。对于宗教本身，我觉得这个剧非常有“爱到深处自然黑”的态度，非常像是宗教本身对自己的反省和自嘲——而我作为一个被各种给我传教的基督徒烦透的无神论者，又很难把“反省和自嘲”和“信教”联系到一起。很有意思。</p><p>突然想起了《暗算：捕风》的一句台词——</p><p>“我不信佛。佛是我的精神寄托，不是信仰。信仰是目标，寄托是需要，是无奈，是不已。信仰是你为它在服务，寄托是它在为你服务。”</p><p>如果按照这个标准的话，其实《摩门经》里所谓的“摩门教”，也并不是什么信仰了。但寄托久了产生信仰，或者因为信仰而寄托，对于人来讲不是自然而然的么？我觉得这句话讲的很好，虽然我不同意这个观点，但它至少解构了我想问的问题。</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vmp-xmguqh4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><hr><p>说到剧，突然想起了这一个半月看过两个让我欲罢不能的电影预告片，都来自迪士尼——</p><p>第一个，真人不对真狮版的《狮子王》。</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/O9EvBdzHvqI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>不是说真人版一定就比漫画版好，但真人版比漫画版一定要强的一点就是——会让人更相信这发生的一切是真的。于是，在循环了这个预告片几百遍后……我真的，真的，真的很想去看东非大迁徙。一开始的大全景乞力马扎罗山非常荡气回肠，而后来当小辛巴被拉飞奇举高高后，长颈鹿斑马都低头行礼——我被野生动物行礼这个场景折服了。</p><p>太。壮。观。了。</p><p>而且一曲Circle of Life，更是一首歌唱出我信奉的人生哲学啊。我惭愧，竟然以前就从来没有太注意这首歌。不过比起有歌词的部分，我最喜欢的还是前面那段我听不懂的对话。明明听不懂歌词讲什么，可我就是能从唱腔和旋律中感受到歌名——生生不息。</p><p>历史和生命永远在以人类打不破的规律循环往复。在我看来，没有比这更美的事物了。</p><p>第二个是Frozen 2。这个更让我完全没想到。</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/eSLe4HuKuK0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Frozen开山之作我还是非常喜欢的，但似乎也就是“非常喜欢”了。谈不上触动心灵，毕竟“触动心灵”这种体验实在太私人了。但是这个预告片真的震撼了我。太大气了，而我对“大气”真的毫无抵抗力。开头Elsa跑不过惊涛骇浪，我竟然看着看着油然而生“即使是有魔法的人类在大自然面前也是多么渺小啊”的在旅途上比较容易发出的感慨。Anna出镜后背景音乐出现了的人声，在我听来仿佛就是原生态的呼唤啊，配上最后一个被秋天染成血红色的Arendelle全景，仿佛把我带回史前时代啊。另外Anna新发型点赞！</p><hr><p>终于读完了美国高中生必读教材——《1984》。可能是因为看之前被剧透了，结局并没有我想象的来的震撼。而读完结局以后，我思考最多的问题是——书中这个社会形态总有一天是要瓦解的，所以，会怎么瓦解呢？</p><p>我相信它会瓦解，并不因为我有多乐观主义（我虽说谈不上很悲观，但真的一点都不乐观）。只是我相信Circle of Life，我不相信任何事物能够保持永恒。任何事物到了最理想的状态下一定会开始走下坡路，到了最黑暗的状态又会开始走上坡路，从而完成一个又一个的循环。在这个大前提下，这种社会形态，过一百年，两百年，三百年，总有一天是会瓦解的。</p><p>但是具体会怎么瓦解呢？我想不出有什么“必然”的原因。只能想出各种偶然事件可能导致的偶然后果。当然，也许还是那句话说的，偶然多了，就有了必然了。</p><hr><p>跟着Gotham Writer’s Workshop上了六周写作课。我现在有点希望我在上大学之前先上了这门课，这样我可能能在大学的Creative Writing课堂上更有心得一些吧。大概讲的也就是初中语文课的内容——表现手法，修辞手法云云。但是因为我之前没有用英文上过这种课，所以对于“英文”这种语言，除了生活中的实用性，我从来没有感受到过语言本身的美感。毕竟和中文的美感好像还是很大相径庭的。</p><p>上了六周课，前三周讲写作手法。第一门课没听，第二门课讲show rather than tell（虽然写中文也要遵循这个道理，但具体应用上我觉得和中文好像有些区别，中国艺术很多时候更讲究抽象化的“意境”而不是具象化的表现），第三门课讲“如何利用你的声音”。后面几门课就开始介绍不同种类的故事应该怎么下手，这方面我倒是觉得靠自己也能领悟就是饿了。</p><p>最后一堂课有人问老师“我们接下来应该接着上什么课呢”老师说“我觉得你们都没必要再上什么课，直接开始写就行了。”虽然心里清楚这门课的含金量可能并不如我预期的高，但还是止不住感到安慰。对于我而言，知道语言怎么样能够产生美感，就能够利用这种知识写出更有美感的文字，足矣。</p><p>现在想想，其实中学时期最爱读的郭敬明落落之流，尤其是郭敬明，还是值得推崇的。对于才上初中，对名家文章无法产生共鸣的我，通过四娘等等这些重口味的词藻堆砌，至少体会到了语言本身带来的美感。现在我已然很看不上那一类词藻和细节堆砌出的华而不实的空中楼阁，但至少，我有了足够的鉴赏和甄别能力来“看不上”他们并毫不心虚。</p><hr><p>其实这半个月想得最多的问题还是，如何控制情绪，以及，到底要不要控制情绪。</p><p>我觉得可以确定的是，当情绪不好的时候，解构自己的情绪，搞清楚“我为什么情绪不好？”非常重要，而且很可能可以缓解不好的情绪。</p><p>这时候“治标还是治本”的问题就来了——我是解决情绪，还是解决带来情绪的问题？</p><p>很多传说中直男和直女的矛盾就是由此引发的。直男倾向于直接解决产生情绪的问题<br>（其实我是更赞同这个的），但是解决问题的本身可能又会产生很多情绪，而且问题一般可能没那么好解决？于是被很多“我只是希望能有人听我说说话”的直女吐槽情商。</p><p>大概是因为去年不知道为什么，我发现“情绪化”好像很耽误事，而且对于改善情绪毫无帮助，我开始努力给自己灌输所谓的“直男思维”——产生了情绪，压下去，先解构再解决问题。一个月以来，我也算是做到了——至少一半都能做到“解构”这部分。</p><p>但是慢慢发现一件很危险的事，我不知道是不是“长大”所付出的代价——当我没有办法在短时间内“解决”问题的时候（……也就是大多数时候），我也没有任何渠道去“解决”情绪本身。好像喝酒和找朋友吐槽，只能暂时解决情绪，管用几个小时，一觉醒来依然是“借酒浇愁愁更愁”。或者是，因为问题没解决，所以新的问题又源源不断冒出来，于是又产生了好多新的坏情绪。</p><p>目前找到的一个好像有点用的方法是练琴。一曲贝多芬弹下来，感觉脑子里面总是空空的只有一个“累”字。</p><p>不过人生课题，在人生应该还长的情况下，也不是那么着急讨论就是了。</p>]]></content>

      自从有了推特和微信朋友圈后，真的越来越少写日记周记随笔了。有点怀念那时候表达欲极强的我，只要双手放到键盘上，不拘内容格式，一定能把想说的话都说个干净。

而现在呢？只一忽儿，2019年就过了七分之一了。看了书写了字，心情起起伏伏，但好像也并没有一定要记载下来的渴望。写博客的意义变成了“以免日后忘了”或者别的什么，总之目的性越来越强。而十年前的我，写博客好像更多的是为了“写博客”本身。

那么，随便写写我这个七分之一吧。




发现了一家很好吃的餐馆，东村的Thursday Kitchen。应该说“好吃的餐馆”在任何城市都不会少，不过会让我觉得“原来菜还可以这么做”的餐厅，我觉得一年下来我能发

      我觉得我好像已经很久没有过过一个这么难忘的一月份了。当然我也不确定过几个月或者过个一两年，我还会不会记得2019年的1月是什么样子。

总而言之就是，诸事不顺，好像一切都如此事与愿违。

月初莫名其妙地在波多黎各被困了10天，耽误的事情我觉得好像还不少。回了纽约后过了一周是MLK小长假，要去看菜师傅结果在我辗转了两个飞机场上气不接下气跑进机舱后，飞机还是取消了。申请签证被RFE了，也就是说，说好的3月份回国参加何青婚礼这事儿，八成也要泡汤了。

错过一次婚礼可能也还可以接受，就怕以后会错过更多次婚礼，甚至错过葬礼。人生一梦，白云苍狗，又还剩多少“仪式”等着人去见证呢。

在我能做到范围的事，我

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>好像是九月底还是十月的时候约了小崔圣诞假去波多黎各，但是因为那之后的两个月我都处于一种既忙且丧的状态，所以行程住宿啥的都基本上是她包办的，而且中间因为我有一个想定的民宿但又拖了好久没定上，导致最后行程全部敲定好像是快十一月底了。现在想想，我2015年圣诞去佛罗里达那次吃过差不多的亏，居然就没长记性。</p><p>可能就是因为这次的“没长记性”，导致我对拉丁美洲的固有印象再次被印证——“热情而不靠谱”。</p><p>怎么个热情而不靠谱呢，讲一个例子——我们在Vieques岛定了个晚上9点去看荧光海的小团，约了8点的出租车过去，结果被爽约了（怎么爽约的又是个无敌奇葩的故事……）于是到了8点我们只好上街看看还有没有正在运营的出租车，自然是没有的。然而在我们等车的时候，旁边酒吧老板看到我们站在那，问了我们要去哪儿干什么以后开始帮我们狂给他认识的人打电话，虽然最终也没叫来车……</p><p>行程如下，</p><ul><li><strong>Day 1:</strong> San Juan，海边溜了溜，去了趟La Placita一个当地人聚众喝酒的地方。当然，因为圣诞节，所以也没看到几个人和开着的店……</li><li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Old San Juan溜了一整天</li><li><strong>Day 3:</strong> 逛了个艺术博物馆，感觉果然这边美术风格都很西班牙😂</li><li><strong>Day 4:</strong> 起了个大早去Ceiba码头等客船去Vieques岛，去那个岛主要是想看波多黎各有名的荧光海的。等了四个多小时才上船，下午两点的snorkling tour自然没赶上。然后晚上9点的bio bay tour，前面说了，也没去成。</li><li><strong>Day 5:</strong> 上午去周边的海滩逛了逛，然后中午回码头接着等船，又晚点了两个多小时……</li><li><strong>Day 6:</strong> 去了离San Juan车程一个多小时的El Yunque热带雨林。本来以为能玩一整天的，不过因为很多路的封了，然后我们也不想顶着烈日爬那条从山脚直通山顶的trail，最后中午三点就回到了San Juan，于是又去了Bacardi酒厂参加了他们的history tour。Bacardi酒厂倒真的像个度假胜地，天蓝草绿让人心情很好。</li></ul><p>本来买了1.9的Hamilton，结果因为各种剧组换场地和推迟而取消了，让我心疼了好久——远程工作不方便不说，关键是我为此多话了$400住宿费怎么算……因为多呆了一个多星期吧，于是我在多出来那周还去了趟Fajardo的荧光海。</p><hr><h4 id="吃饭篇"><a href="#吃饭篇" class="headerlink" title="吃饭篇"></a>吃饭篇</h4><p>以南美菜和西班牙菜为主，讲真还蛮好吃的！一开始经常会点海鲜饭墨鱼饭什么的，确实吃的很香。后来还在海边点了一条烤鱼，像我这种怕鱼刺星人竟然把一整条吃的只剩刺，对我来讲真的超级不容易了！</p><p><img src="/images/red-snapper.jpg" alt="Red Snapper"></p><p>还有一个观察——好像每次去拉美国家旅行，“鸡尾酒”都是其中的重头戏。去墨西哥要喝Tequila，去古巴有什么“海明威喝过的Daiquiri“，这次来了波多黎各，除了之前提到的Bacardi酒厂以外，还去了Pina Colada被发明出来那个餐厅喝了。感觉比起美国大陆的Pina Colada更多菠萝味，且没那么齁甜齁甜的……</p><p><img src="/images/bacardi.jpg" alt="Bacardi"><br><img src="/images/pina-colada.JPG" alt="Piña Colada"></p><p>不过嘛比较悲伤的是，这个岛毕竟不像纽约，别说亚洲菜了连意大利菜都不算多。每天吃这种重油的食物，吃到最后一周我真的是啥都吃不下，看到拉美/西班牙菜就想吐😂</p><h4 id="交通篇"><a href="#交通篇" class="headerlink" title="交通篇"></a>交通篇</h4><p>公共交通不太完善，我们在San Juan住的地方虽然算是个比较人多的居民区，但是想坐大巴去老城区依然要等一个小时车。好在San Juan上uber还挺普遍，所以交通也不是什么大问题。</p><p>去了和中国农村差不多的Vieques岛就不一样了。没有公交也没有Uber，不管是街上的出租车还是那些私人运营的小黑车，天色一晚基本就都没了，于是基本上哪儿都去不了了。</p><p>后面几天是租车开的。这边的车开的超级快也就不多了，加塞并道生猛程度和北京差不多。但这还不是最牛的，最牛的事路上一堆坑，开着开着就突然咣当一下……</p><p>连平时走路都很有意思——San Juan路上各种酒瓶碎片渣子让我走起路来有时候提心吊胆的，过马路也没有红绿灯，就算有红绿灯感觉也好像都坏掉了。不过这里车基本上只要看到路边站了行人一定会停下来让行人先走，一开始还挺让我们感动的，但住到后来我就开始觉得还是红绿灯好……</p><h4 id="景点篇"><a href="#景点篇" class="headerlink" title="景点篇"></a>景点篇</h4><p>一般我知道来波多黎各的，不外乎会打卡以下几个地方——San Juan，荧光海，Culebra岛的白沙滩，El Yunque雨林。Culebra白沙滩我没去（主要是觉得不可能比圣灵群岛还好看啊……），其他的看完一圈，总体觉得自然景观一般，城市文化还挺有看头。</p><ul><li>Old San Juan: 先是去了城墙。第一次见到这么有人情味的军事重地，墙壁上爬着海鬣蜥，外面的草坪上有好多人放风筝，而且纪念品商店卖的东西都很不错，便宜而粗糙朴实反而很打动我。城墙外面的小镇也很有情调，浅蓝浅黄浅粉色的西班牙风格小镇让人心情还挺愉快的。<br><img src="/images/old-san-juan.jpg" alt="Old San Juan"></li><li>El Yunque: 只能说，去了这么多热带雨林，连亚马逊都去过了，每次感觉都是“只缘身在此山中”——没有照片和电影里看着好看。除了一篇绿油油的以外，鲜艳的花鸟虫毕竟都太小。具体到El Yunque就是，现在给游客开放的地方出了一条游客不少的trail以外，就是一堆塔和一些瀑布，拍几张照片算是“到此一游”以后，似乎也没太多别的可以体验了，只能打道回府。</li><li>白沙滩：虽然没去Culebra的白沙滩，不过在Vieques去了一个沙滩，觉得质量还是可以的。最喜欢浅蓝色的水白色的沙，沙滩的坡度也还比较平，往海里走上几米也不过是没到大腿。沙滩边上的石头好像还有甲虫化石啥的，蛮有意思的！</li><li>荧光海：1.9晚上去了Fajardo的荧光海，算是打卡了一个所谓“奇观”吧。去之前在网上看很多人说了“不要信照片”，所以已经把期望值降到很低了，但真正到了以后我依然还是很失望……荧光效果不明显不是什么问题，毕竟还是看得出来的。关键是颜色根本就不好看啊！说好的蓝绿色的呢！说好的像萤火虫闪光呢！为什么我看到的就是普通的银白色啊，和城市里下大雨水滴溅起来的颜色基本上是一样的。我曾以为奇观之“奇”足以让我震撼，现在想想，好像之前令我感动到失语的所谓“奇观”，并不是因为其“奇”，还是因为其“美”吧。倒是在黑夜的红树林里完全摸着黑划皮艇还挺有意思的，剧烈运动本身加环境刺激确实可以让肾上腺素飙升，很爽。</li></ul><hr><p>玩玩这一趟再想想四年前去佛罗里达那一趟，得出的结论就是以后圣诞节还是别去加勒比海了，一定要去也要去更南边一点更冷门一点的地方嘛（比如厄瓜多尔）……如果一定要去的话，要满足两个条件——</p><ol><li>有钱住海边的好酒店，这样各类旅游团都可以让酒店包办了</li><li>早定，要不然酒店和旅团被人订光了，有钱也没用</li></ol><p>这里要强烈推荐<a href="https://www.kayakingpuertorico.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kayaking Puerto Rico</a>这个旅行社，不仅价格公道（San Juan和Fajardo接送才$20）而且靠谱的我都以为不在波多黎各……</p><p>首先我打电话过去的时候他们就说虽然人数够成团了，但是可能从San Juan接送人数不够。中间一直在和我保持联系，问我愿不愿意负担因为租车人数不够所带来的费用。临走前一天又跟我说天气可能不好，问我愿不愿意另做打算，并帮我改签到了我能去的团。和他们客服通话了五六次吧，每次体验都特别棒，而且又一次我好像是晚上八点多打了个电话过去没人接，我也没留电话留言什么的，竟然在半小时内收到了回电，这在拉美这个大环境下是怎样惊天地泣鬼神的敬业啊😂</p><p>唯一需要注意的就是需要提前至少一周定，至少我12.29号要定任何团，最早也只能订到1.3还是1.4的了……</p>]]></content>

可能就是因为这次的“没长记性”，导致我对拉丁美洲的固有印象再次被印证——“热情而不靠谱”。

怎么个热情而不靠谱呢，讲一个例子——我们在Vieques岛定了个晚上9点去看荧光海的小团，约了8点的出租车过去，结果被爽约了（怎么爽约的又是个无敌奇葩的故事……）于是到了8点我们只好上街看看还有没有正在

      迟来的一篇跨年总结，之前没写主要是因为被困在加勒比某岛上了😂

2017年过的算是起起伏伏抓马略多，于是年底许的愿望是“想安安稳稳drama free的过一年”。这个愿望算是实现了，不过一年过下来我最大的感受就是——好像我什么都没干。这种感受怪让人气馁的，所以只能说一年前的这个目标定的不太好。尤其是从九月到十二月初，可能是因为厌烦了学习，感觉过的非常，非常，非常之丧。

总结一下18年自己觉得不够满意的，

 1. 出门旅游几次，感觉都中规中矩。玩的时候还算开心，但除此之外好像也没有更多的感觉了。而且一张好照片都没拍到，真是一张都没……😢
 2. 练琴：三天打鱼两天晒网。倒是可以弹下来《第

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>等了好久终于看到Crimes of Grindelwald了。为了保证第一次进影院的惊艳感，我特地在进电影院之前只看了预告片，除此之外什么都没看，原声都没听。</p><p>整体感觉——导演组没hold住，但是雀斑裘花德普三大咖果然没让我失望。罗婶更是像往常一样，总是能在抖包袱那一瞬间让我大呼“原来如此！”</p><p>这一部的高潮结局抖包袱部分，看的真是相当之爽。感觉非常像是，盲人终于又见到了光。</p><p>所以罗婶真的是上帝啊，想要哪儿有光，哪儿就能有光！上一张图秀一下我们罗婶的名字！以及把剧透部分给隔开，没看电影的小伙伴们就不要往下看了……另外还有少许Lethal White的剧透，不过不涉及犯人，透的应该不算多😂</p><p><img src="/images/fb2rowling.jpg" alt="Ending"></p><p>毕竟第一次看，大脑一直在努力处理情节，所以除了最后抖包袱的时候大呼过瘾以外，前面的很多部分我到现在还在努力理解和消化，可能得等到二刷的时候能完全看明白了。</p><p>虽然看的时候没觉得，但是看完以后仔细想，越想越觉得这电影果然和Lethal White的小说前后两个月内问世的，故事估计也是差不多时间写的，因此结构真的非常像啊！故事都是从某个有地位声望的家族展开，一大堆亲戚关系要弄明白，然后故事里的所有人都能两两凑cp，最后包袱一抖——哈？原来这几个八竿子打不着的人也是cp？</p><ul><li><strong>Newtina线</strong>——中间聊到感情那一段太尬了……虽然说第一段结尾也挺尬的，但是至少两个人还能说出整句整句的话吧，这一部他俩感情戏我觉得有点用力过猛了。加上这部的故事也不完全是围绕他俩展开的，所以这条线我觉得看头一般。</li><li><strong>马戏团苦命鸳鸯线</strong>——非常喜欢这两个人的故事，讲的也很好。应该说这条线的重头戏在后面（纳吉尼永久变蛇并认识伏地魔），所以这部电影里面更多以平铺直叙为主，也没有太强烈的暗流涌动，但这个开头讲的非常扎实，台词少而情感深，颇有点《飞屋环游记》开头那8分钟爱情故事的感觉。电影没怎么交代Credence和Nagini怎么认识的，甚至给他们互相之间的台词都很少，但我完全可以感同身受两个苦命人相依为命的信任和默契，毫不突兀还觉得很温柔很亲切。</li><li><strong>红毛兄弟线</strong>——我看之前对忒修斯·斯卡曼德的印象真的就是珀西，现在打脸了😂长得那么一本正经的居然是个护弟狂魔+拥抱狂魔，而且勇敢无畏的超级有凤凰社风格！两个人的互动真的很有爱了！期待后续发展！</li><li><strong>朱砂痣白月光线</strong>——丽塔和纽特回忆这段真的感觉还蛮回味悠长的，怎么说呢让我回想到了死圣下里面斯内普的回忆。一个来自黑暗，心中充满恨，一个温柔敦厚，心中充满爱，那么后者自然成为前者如救命稻草一般，却因为自卑而永远不敢与之并肩的存在。我以为这部电影会交代兄弟俩和丽塔的三角恋到底是怎么一回事呢，现在觉得纽特和丽塔也不一定就在一起过。但可以猜到的是，就像斯内普永远不敢追求莉莉一样，会说出”you’re too good Newt, you’ve never met a beast you couldn’t love”的丽塔，应该也没有底气和纽特并肩作战一辈子的吧。对于他们来讲，飞蛾扑火一般以性命保护这份他们不敢企及的美好，算是最好的结局了。</li><li><strong>GGAD线</strong>——可能是因为两个人一直没同框吧，这条线目前感觉除了那个牢不可破誓言以外好像没太多实质性内容可看的。魔镜里两个少年划破手心山盟海誓（？）那段算是这条线最扣人心悬的场景了，主要是Jamie那一只眼睛的眼神太勾魂了！这里给裘德洛打call!!! 中青年邓布利多真的和我想象中的一模一样，而且那种若有若无的狡黠非常像我们怀念的Richard Harris…</li><li><strong>面包组线</strong>——这条线我觉得是前半段电影中最精彩的，篇幅不多但每个场景都一击即中，Queenie坐在雨里被各种听不懂的无线电波（？）折磨的时候真的让人很心疼了！第一部里一直觉得他俩主要是在调剂气氛，因为没有推动情节所以对于这两个人物也没有深挖，那么这一部里面寥寥几个镜头，把两个人的弱点都表现了出来，形象瞬间立体化了。题外话，Queenie这种外刚内柔的纠结人设，咳咳是我们巨蟹座的没跑了！</li><li><strong>黑人傲罗大哥线</strong>——充分证明了我前面说的本片情节和Lethal White的结构很像。所有人都能组cp，组不上cp的人身上都有大包袱要抖……</li></ul><hr><p>记得我看完神奇动物1的时候，提出了<a href="https://orzzai.github.io/2016/11/28/spoilers-alert-e5-85-b3-e4-ba-8ehp-e4-b8-8e-e7-a5-9e-e5-85-bd-e7-b3-bb-e5-88-97-e7-9a-84-e7-a2-8e-e7-a2-8e-e5-bf-b5/">几个问题</a>。现在来数数这部电影回答了多少个，又问了哪些其他问题：</p><p><strong>1) Will we die, just a little?</strong></p><p>本片没回答这个问题，估计得等GGAD同框了才会告诉我们了吧。</p><p><strong>2) Modesty是谁？</strong></p><p>之前一直在猜这孩子到底有没有魔法，而且一直觉得她之后会出现。有点可惜啊，感觉罗婶好像放弃这个角色了，我真的好喜欢这小孩啊。虽然可能性很小，但希望她之后几部能出来打个酱油啊……</p><p><strong>3) Credence还活着吗？</strong></p><p>这个问题倒是回答了，不过我有点想知道他到底为什么没死。这点电影没回答，而且我看以后是不打算回答了。</p><p><strong>4) 纽特和Tina对Credence的歉意是否会在接下来的故事中推动情节发展？</strong></p><p>之前我是这么猜的：</p><blockquote><p>电影中让我非常在意的一点是，最后Newt和Tina都不想杀掉Credence而是想留着过年来着（咦）可是部长大人叫了一帮人在Credence最脆弱没有防备的时候把他杀了。这点一直让我心神不宁，我觉得罗婶不会允许她的故事中有一个毫无防御能力的人被杀死，而没有人去思考和反省这件事情的。她也绝对不会浪费这个可以推动故事情节的机会。所以，肯定的，而且这段故事多半会和电影最后那缕黑烟扯一块去……</p></blockquote><p>很高兴，除了本片没解释上一部最后那缕黑烟以外，其他的都和我想的大同小异。</p><p><strong>5) 真正的Graves还活着吗？</strong></p><p>又是一条被放弃了的线。好吧我觉得这条线放弃了也就放弃了，就是有点可惜科林法瑞尔不会再出来耍帅了😂</p><p><strong>6) Tina当傲罗的时候发生了什么？和Graves是不是有什么不得不说的故事？还有她和Barebone家族到底有什么恩怨情仇</strong></p><blockquote><p>总之就是Tina的故事肯定还是需要好好介绍一下的。科林法瑞尔最后那一声Tinnie摆明了俩人之间有故事，因此嗯……回到上一题，Graves应该还活着！嗯，站他俩cp，希望发生过点暧昧的故事吧❤️</p></blockquote><p>我想多了……</p><blockquote><p>和Barebone发生过什么，猜不出来，而且老实说没啥兴趣……至于当傲罗的时候发生了什么，我觉得后面多半会讲。但是目前的只有两条线索，一个是她以前用Gnarlak当线人，还有就是她抓过小酒馆里一半的人。这也就是为什么我觉得后面几部里面Gnarlak会帮她……</p></blockquote><p>这个我觉得我未必想多了，希望后几部能把这条线索接上，能多交代点Goldstein姐妹俩的故事。</p><p><strong>7) Leta Lestrange何许人？和纽特被开除有什么关系？<br>8) 纽特他哥是谁？家里好像是贵族啊？</strong></p><p>我之前觉得丽塔“肯定不是个什么好人”果然是图样图森破，丽塔这个人比我想象的复杂多了！这条线非常满意！而且因为纽特他哥没死，所以丽塔的故事应该还没有完全讲完。既然如此的话，纽特怎么开除啥的，我相信之后也会提到的！</p><p>贵族不贵族什么的……不知道为啥，我现在不太关心这个问题了。就好像波特家，不算贵族但算望族，不用像贵族一样背负着”家族荣誉“的压力，又有点钱有点名可以让孩子做自己喜欢的事（詹姆打球搞恶作剧，纽特养动物），最好了呀。</p><p><strong>9) 报社二公子之后有没有故事？</strong></p><p>之前猜了好久，倾向于没有。看来确实没有了。</p><p><strong>10) Jacob真的忘记所有事情了吗？</strong></p><blockquote><p>我倾向于应该是忘记了，私心里觉得他就此忘记一切的话故事比较美。就像我们这些麻瓜麻鸡，看了一场哈利波特系列电影，就像做了一场梦一样。但如果忘记了的话……说好了原来的四人组都会出现在下一部电影的呢？</p></blockquote><p>很多网友都猜到他会出现是因为他对魔法的回忆都很美好。嗯，比我厉害多了。</p><p><strong>11) 邓校的妹妹是Obscurial吗？是否认识Newt？</strong></p><p>看来得再等几部……</p><p><strong>12) 格林德沃会预言吗？或者说有没有个人帮他预言啥的</strong></p><p>我之前这么猜的，</p><blockquote><p>俩可能：a.格林德沃魔法很强，魔法强的人多半直觉也很好，于是他全都靠直觉知道了这些事情；b.和伏地魔一样，他或者他认识的人听到了一个什么预言……<br>其实还有一个更加耸人听闻的c.除了Credence本人以外，还有一个人知道他是Obscurial！并且通过某种方式透漏给了格林德沃！但是可能是因为临死前透漏的，或者其他原因（没看清楚人之类），只透漏了一半……<br>为什么我会这么想呢是因为，a感觉不严谨不像罗婶的作风；b重复了劳德的模式，有点无聊……只好努力开动脑筋拼凑一个c出来，希望靠谱Orz</p></blockquote><p>这部电影交代了格林德沃手里那个骷髅头好像可以预言很多事情（二战都出来了😂），但是它到底是个什么东西，能怎么预言，我还是没搞清楚，不知道后面会不会交代。</p><p><strong>13) 下一部电影会怎么讲？</strong></p><blockquote><p>大胆猜一下开头：格林德沃逃狱，又去欧洲兴风作浪。美国魔法部长（嗯这位姐姐也很有戏啊）带着一帮人，包括重新成为了傲罗的Tina跑到欧洲去捉格林德沃。然后在欧洲碰到纽特和邓校人等……在这个过程中还找到了真正的Graves。嗯不过我有点想不出来这里怎么把Modesty的戏份加进去……</p></blockquote><p>我现在看到我脑补的这个为啥觉得这么搞笑😂</p><p><strong>14) 邓校谁来演！</strong></p><p>真不是我事后诸葛亮，不过在公布之前我真的有猜过会不会是裘花。英国人+中年+能和德普飙戏+还没演过HP系列+不是卷福。这几个条件限定了，网上一搜我觉得只能搜出个位数了……</p><hr><p>嗯，看了两部，我觉得是不是应该开始总结一下魔法世界年表了？</p><p>？ 尤瑟夫卡玛出生<br>？ 丽塔莱斯特兰奇出生<br>？ 丽塔莱斯特兰奇她弟弟出生，同年克雷登斯出生<br>？ 丽塔一家坐船去美国，丽塔偷梁换柱，亲生弟弟死亡，克雷登斯被带去美国<br>？ 克雷登斯被Barebone家族收nue养dai<br>？ Tina看到克雷登斯养母虐待他仗义出手，因此搞丢工作<br>1926 克雷登斯和装成Graves的GG接触，同年纽特来纽约，经历了一系列事情以后克雷登斯原地爆炸炸死他妈<br>1927 克雷登斯为了找家人去了法国，认识了纳吉尼，并得知自己真实身份<br>1945 GGAD大战，AD赢得老魔杖，GG被关在Nurmengard<br>1981 哈利波特出生</p><p>目前这个年表里面还需要插入的有<br>？ GGAD认识<br>？ AD妹妹死亡<br>？ 纳吉尼认识伏地魔<br>？ 纳吉尼永久变成蛇</p><p>还有什么漏下的之后慢慢补……</p>]]></content>

      等了好久终于看到Crimes of Grindelwald了。为了保证第一次进影院的惊艳感，我特地在进电影院之前只看了预告片，除此之外什么都没看，原声都没听。

整体感觉——导演组没hold住，但是雀斑裘花德普三大咖果然没让我失望。罗婶更是像往常一样，总是能在抖包袱那一瞬间让我大呼“原来如此！”

这一部的高潮结局抖包袱部分，看的真是相当之爽。感觉非常像是，盲人终于又见到了光。

所以罗婶真的是上帝啊，想要哪儿有光，哪儿就能有光！上一张图秀一下我们罗婶的名字！以及把剧透部分给隔开，没看电影的小伙伴们就不要往下看了……另外还有少许Lethal White的剧透，不过不涉及犯人，透的应该不算多😂

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>托我爸的福，一直以来我自认为也算是经常跑户外的人了。比较业余的户外装备我七七八八的也全都有，厚底鞋脚上一穿，爬个石头溯个溪神马的毫无压力。但是……</p><p>我！居然没有在外面露过营……！</p><p>一想到身边好多一年也不一定会跑一次户外的人，竟然都是露过营的，我就觉得心里很不平衡。但我又深知露营这种活动不稳定因素太多，第一次断断不能一个人上路，于是在Google老半天以后找到了<a href="https://www.awalkinthewoods.com/pages/wd_backpacking.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Walk in the Woods</a>，报名了他们三天两夜的团Smoky Mountain Backpacking Adventure，然后就等着上路了。应该说我选择在大烟山来达成第一次露营的成就也是有意而为之的，毕竟对它隔壁的Appalachian Trail非常有乡土情结，而且蛮希望以后有机会thru-hike…</p><p>因为也不确定自己会不会喜欢这项活动（刚到美国第一次和W&amp;L outing club出门结果被落在后面找不到路的黑历史给我留下了巨大的心理阴影，从此和美国人一起户外都会怵三分），也不确定我会不会哭着回来大喊妈妈我以后再也不作死了……于是除了自己的睡袋并没有买其他任何户外用品。大多东西都是和户外老司机哥们儿借了（最后还把人登山杖弄丢了一只😂），单人帐篷是和带玩的公司租的。以为只租帐篷会比租全套便宜，结果发现租是一样的价钱，早知道直接在那租全套了还省得我从纽约背俩包上飞机再背回去，累死了……</p><hr><p>三天总共走了20多迈绕了个大圈，不算长。大概在整个大烟山国家公园东南角位置，离Oconaluftee Visitor Center不远。下面这张图上的亮粉色是我们的路线，我们是从Smokemount开始顺时针走起，划了圈的是这两天的营地……</p><p><img src="/images/smoky-trail.png" alt="Smoky Mt Trail Map"></p><p>整个团一个领队带四个群众，另外三个人一个是年龄可以给我当妈的阿姨，走的确实比较慢；另外有两个差不多大的印度男生和美国女生。除了领队和同龄美国女生以外，其他三个人都是第一次出来扎营，我压力顿时小了很多……</p><p>装备方面，领队带了滤水器和烧水的煤气灶还有小急救箱，噢还给带了块抹布给洗碗。我们其他人各自带了两天的早晚餐（都是泡泡热水就能变成一顿饭的那种，讲真比我想象中好吃，尤其是意式肉酱面和必胜客的一个味儿……）还有零食当中午饭（我带少了，默……）</p><p>一路温度大概10度，我身上穿了有</p><ul><li>贴身衣服</li><li>我的标志性粉色冲锋衣，里面没带抓绒那种</li><li>一件羊毛背心</li><li>快干裤</li></ul><p>这里疯狂点赞羊毛背心！穿在冲锋衣外面一点不违和，因为是背心所以也不影响身体活动的灵活性。但是，超！级！暖！和！！！</p><p>然后备用的内衣内裤袜子带了一套，后来果然用上了……</p><hr><p>第一天中午十二点半才出发，一直沿着小河小溪，而且前两迈都是走的大道，所以啥感觉都没有就走到营地了，我也就喝了不到半瓶瓶装水……一路走向导一路给我们介绍各种路边的植物，还有大烟山国家公园的历史云云，都还挺有意思的，不过我每次听这方面的科普都觉得我英文不够用😂</p><p>到49号营地大概下午五点半六点的样子？第一次搭帐篷，我总觉得那个说明书写的有点逻辑问题所以一开始一直没搭起来，不过多试了几次也算是成功了，就是指甲缝里不知道为啥进了很多泥，让我这个对指甲缝清洁程度有强迫症的人很不舒服，不过过一会儿好像就好了。搭完帐篷吃晚饭（一大堆干粮装在一个密封袋里，浇热水等十分钟就能吃了还挺好吃，大概和泡面是同一种操作……）一直都很顺利，就是晚上睡觉的时候我觉得我那个25-35f的睡袋不太hold得住，而且防潮垫的长度只有半个身子，导致我双脚冰凉冰凉，因此一夜都没睡着😂没睡着的时候也真的在想，我来这儿受这苦干啥？我又不是没睡过能听着风声水声睡觉而且还经常有野生动物进来做客的小木屋，多一床床垫和被子好像也并不会影响我感受自然的啊？</p><p>第二天的徒步开始变得有（高）意（难）思（度）很多，虽然很累但确实更像是我心中徒步该有的样子。从营地往外走了快一迈后，就是两个多迈上山路，我在爬坡的这两三个小时内搞定了整瓶瓶装水……也就是在这个时候我们五个人的前后距离开始很明显的拉开，印度哥们儿和同龄美国姐们儿跟着领队走在前面，我一边爬一边喘气远远把他们落在后面，然后美国阿姨又被我远远甩在后面😂说句不厚道的，幸亏有这位阿姨给我垫背，要不然真的是八年前outing club悲剧重现，我会被peer pressure的压力给难受死吧。</p><p>大概爬山爬到一半就开始下雨。本来没觉得下雨是什么大事儿，毕竟也不是什么倾盆大雨，打在头顶上也没啥感觉，但后来我发现这点毛毛雨的后果在山里的比在城里要大不少……首先，一边上山一边下雨，到了山顶真是特别冷，体感大概5摄氏度吧。这冷到还是其次，关键是后面的下坡路非常，非常，非常的泥泞。好在这点我也不带怕的，对自己的登山鞋有充分的信心，但这样走起路来总是比之前费更多脑子了。</p><p>重点来了，大概上Enloe Creek Trail走了一小会儿，当我们觉得差不多该快到营地的时候，发现居然要淌一条齐膝高的瀑布。中间能看到几块大石头，我还以为是要从那几块石头上一个一个摸过去，于是面不改色心不跳的穿着鞋就下去了。下去了才听到领队在我后面对我吼，说你不要去够那几块石头！直接走过去！于是毫无疑问，我的鞋里哗哗哗进了好多冰凉的溪水……</p><p>好不容易淌过去了，我虽然脚被泡的不太舒服但也无所谓，觉得这应该很快就要到营地了吧。结果一行人又走了大半天，走到天黑了，领队突然停下来，开始疯狂研究地图，然后对我们说……对不起啊同志们我们走错了，当时好像不应该淌那个瀑布，我需要往回走走找找路……</p><p>于是领队和印度小哥沿着来路回去了，美国小姐姐陪着阿姨在后面慢慢走。我本来觉得我前面有人后面也有人，应该不是什么大问题，结果不知道为啥过了没两分钟，前后距离就拉开的特别特别远。又走了好久，我总觉得应该走到了吧结果感觉怎么越走路越长啊，我不会走错了吧！这时候天已经完全黑了下来，我完全是靠头灯在看路，前不见人后不见鬼，大喊了一声没人理，可以说是心里非常害怕了！这种感觉其实前几天在Blue Ridge Parkway附近那些弯弯曲曲的小路上开夜车的时候也有点，但那时候至少副驾上还有同行的妹子一起啊！少不得深呼吸，努力冷静下来，想一想我走上岔路的可能性，觉得我应该没走错，于是接着往前走，果然又走了一会儿，又看见领队和印度小哥在前面看地图。</p><p>我不得不佩服印度小哥这神一般的方向感，第一次出来徒步（他真的是第一次）在这电话线一样的山路里转了几百圈居然还能一秒在纸质地图上找到定位，而且比我们领队一个二十年的户外老司机还笃定。（后来我们领队说他自己主要是被各种场外信息误导了：首先觉得我们走的路比地图和路标上显示的里程数要多很多，然后他以前去47号营地的时候不记得有过过河……）反正听了印度小哥叽里咕噜一阵，大概意思就是，咱刚才根本没走错！掉头，接着往前走！</p><p>走了我觉得大概半个小时？（在山里我这个时间概念应该不太准……）终于到了一个特别小还有一半被大石头围起来了的营地。到了营地我才开始发现自己穿着湿乎乎的东西在冷天里走了一路，浑身都控制不住地在发抖。同时因为双手僵掉了，所以任何动作做起来都很费劲，比如扎帐篷——我现在回想一下我那天晚上摸黑扎帐篷的样子如果录下来，一定非常好玩，像个老款的机器人，做任何动作都是正常人的三分之一倍速。我现在对那帐篷铁架子的触感印象还是非常深——我小时候看科普书，知道固体温度低到一定程度的时候摸起来会“烫”，然而好像一直没有体验过这种感觉，直到摸了那几根帐篷架……</p><p>好嘛终于可以钻睡袋了，这才发现我身上所有贴身的东西已经全都湿了……很想回到大家放包的地方把备用的拿出来换上，但是一想到要从睡袋里爬出来，整个身体就非常诚实的在抗议……于是我把身上袜子之类能脱掉的东西都脱了，放在外面希望睡一夜能晾干的。后来马马虎虎半睡半醒过了几个小时，天亮了……湿的衣服没晾干，干衣服反而“晾”湿了😂</p><p>第三天，因为知道是最后一天了，所以心里大概只有一个盼头就是——洗澡！我要洗澡！美国阿姨已经开始说“对不起啊我有点臭”，两个男的倒是啥话没说，但我能闻到他们身上真的开始起味儿了，而我自己……不知道，不想猜。好在这最后一天的路是真的不要太好走，除了头一天淌的河要再淌一次以外，剩下的全是大下坡。大概8个迈，我光脚套了双耐克跑鞋（登山鞋还是湿的），毫不费力的就走完了。</p><p><img src="/images/smoky-hike.jpg" alt="Smoky Mt Hike"></p><p>非常神奇的是，这么多天路走下来，而且在每天都吃的不多睡的不好的情况下，到最后完全并没有“好累啊我啥都不想干只想和床单被子天荒地老”的感觉（这好像是我每天下班回家容易有的感觉）……腰也不酸背也不痛，10斤的背包也不觉得多沉，两脚可能是因为穿的好鞋，所以连块皮都没磨破。当天晚上又在Gatlinburg镇上来回了两个迈去吃饭。反之，发现腿部韧带很明显地变软了，以前伸直腿弯腰，指尖怎么也够不到地板，在第三天尝试的时候发现轻而易举，这还是在我的登山鞋鞋底超级厚的情况下……</p><p>不过不知道有没有伤到脚，前几天每次转动脚踝，脚后跟上面的软骨都会有摩擦感，虽然不是很严重但总让我心里很害怕，总觉得这脚不会落下什么病吧……很神奇，今天早上醒来，发现居然就这么神奇的好了😂</p><hr><p>总的来说觉得这个团是很值得来的，想达到的目的基本都达到了。感受到了背着10斤的包连续徒步20多迈带来的成就感，掌握了一些比较基础的野外生存技能，也大概明白了在欧美国家“扎营”是怎么个操作。只有一个目标没达到的，那就是搞清楚一件事情——我是真的喜欢这个活动吗？</p><p>这次带出来用的东西除了睡袋全都是借的，最重要的原因就是不确定自己会不会喜欢在外面露营，怕回头如果决定“老子以后再也不露营了”买的东西全都白买。果然，当我躲在睡袋里瑟瑟发抖的时候，我真的心里在想，又不是睡不起床单被子，我为什么要跑来这里找罪受？</p><p>但是让我真的就此以后再也不尝试出来长途跋涉，我又觉得并不甘心。明明在我看着领队给我们滤水烧水做饭的时候，我心里确实想的是“哪天我能撸袖子自己上呢”。</p><p>于是前两天下班路上和我组里同事聊天。这位同事人称天才少年，是我认识的非常少数出远门路子比我还野的人：在城里玩喜欢免费couchsurf陌生人沙发，去野外玩喜欢睡深山老林。而且这哥们儿经常自黑自己是control freak，这点也是比我有过之无不及。所以和他聊这个问题应该说是比较合适的。</p><p>我：“你为什么喜欢在外面扎营啊？我知道扎营可以<strong>enjoy</strong>大自然，可是你睡个森林小木屋啥的，自然体验真的不比在外面搭帐篷差的，而且还有<del>老婆孩子</del>热炕头……”<br>天少：“不不不，我不是想<strong>enjoy</strong>大自然，我是想<strong>survive</strong>大自然，会有操控一切的成就感。”</p><p>茅塞顿开。</p><p>怎么说呢，我觉得他说出了我潜意识里的想法，只是长时间以来我可能一直没意识到自己是那么想的。小时候的我一直想长大了就不用被爸妈养，长大后的我一直想去做一些“路子很野”的事情比如一个人去语言不通的国家，免费去couchsurf，为了省几块钱不住酒店住青旅（即使省下来的那点钱很有可能因为去了青旅发现前台没人而翻倍花去住酒店），去坑坑洼洼的小径或陡峭的悬崖上爬山，在车技未成的时候大剌剌地开一辆车自驾左右对调的澳大利亚，甚至一个人去做“最好不要一个人做”的事情因为想试试看我经不经的住孤独感……还有，喜欢看《饥饿游戏》是因为非常，非常羡慕嫉妒女主角Katniss。</p><p>我从小到大“潜意识”里求生欲都很强。可能是因为我潜意识里总是很怕自己换个环境就会挂掉（我也不知道为啥我会怕这个……），而环境会不会变往往自己又控制不了，所以我最希望证明我可以在从任何恶劣环境中活着走出来，并以此非常自豪。</p><p>不过上面这两段话对于一篇游记来讲其实完全是废话。所以一句话总结——看来我得真的自己在不跟老司机的情况下在荒山老林里住一晚上活着出来，我才能想明白我到底喜不喜欢露营。</p>]]></content>

      2018年10月30日。金庸居然也走了，享年94岁。

而且竟然没有给后代留下倚天屠龙，也没有什么武功秘籍。

记得好像是中考完以后看的《射雕英雄传》，到现在依然是我最喜欢的金庸小说，闭上眼睛就能闻到的青涩少年感。

后来在高中同学的安利下，花了五天在后排课桌下面和宿舍被窝里面看完了《天龙八部》。从此乔峰就成为了我心目中神一样的存在，屹立不倒。

后来断断续续读完了全部15本金庸小说，最后一本是高三考完最后一次托福后读的《鹿鼎记》。

非常喜欢郭襄所以混过百度郭襄吧，还当过一段时间吧主。虽然受不了百度贴吧的气氛，不过在百度郭襄吧认识了两个很重要的朋友。其中一个亲眼见证从单身狗变成宠妹狂魔到现在

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>自从四年前本科毕业带着家人走了一趟Blue Ridge Pkwy和大烟山以后，就一直想秋季再回来一趟。毕竟在Appalachians Mountains呆了四年，每年秋天都会望着山里一层红一层黄一层白的山色思考人生，而那时唯一的遗憾就是当时不会开车，没有机会真正进山区好好体验一下拍个照。今年秋天回来一趟，算是弥补了几年来的遗憾，也算是排遣一下对美国大南方的乡愁了。</p><p>说来奇怪，好像越是闭塞保守的地方，越容易给我带来“乡愁感”——明明在那里的时候拼了命的想逃出来，逃出来以后也不会想再回去生活，但每当想到的时候，还是觉得记忆中的那段岁月那片土地是温柔的。</p><p>我果真是怀旧的巨蟹座啊。</p><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oTeUdJky9rY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>行程大概是这样——</p><ul><li><strong>Day 0:</strong> 晚上7点半到Washington Dulles，机场租了车，在Annadale吃了个饭买了零食和水，然后开两小时夜路到Harrisonburg</li><li><strong>Day 1:</strong> 早上附近吃了brunch，中午12点进入Shennandoah Valley NP的Swift Gap Entrance，然后一路向北，一下午在车上刷完Skyline Drive的观景台，还花了一个多小时走了<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/virginia/upper-hawksbill-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upper Hawksbill Trail.</a></li><li><strong>Day 2:</strong> 基本上是纯赶路了，中午11点从Skyline Drive上Blue Ridge Pkwy一路向南，中途在Otter’s Creek吃了顿野餐，Peaks of the Otter（应该是Virginia段最美了）和Mabry Mills休息拍照。到Mabry Mills的时候已经下午六点多了，于是从这里直接离开Blue Ridge Pkwy，从高速公路上赶到晚上住的地方：北卡的Blowing Rock.</li><li><strong>Day 3:</strong> 从Blowing Rock回到Blue Ridge Pkwy，一开始走错路沿着Blowing Rock Pkwy开了好久还下车拍了好多照片，绕道正道上的时候大概12点，第一站是Linn Cove Visitor center，那旁边有个大高架桥非常漂亮。然后开到Linville Falls走了一个多小时的<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/north-carolina/erwins-view-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erwins View Trail</a>，有三个观景台可以看瀑布看山，非常值得看值得拍。出来以后大概下午四点，开了两个小时在路边各种都拍了拍，日落时分到了Milepost 417的Looking Glass Rock Overlook拍了一张我很喜欢的皂片，然后出了高速直接赶到Gatlinburg, TN我们住的酒店。</li><li><strong>Day 4:</strong> 早上八点半进入大烟山，一天内打卡了Clingmans Dome, <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/tennessee/peregrine-peak-via-alum-cave-bluffs-trail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alum Cave Trail</a>, <a href="https://smokymountains.com/park/things-to-do/roaring-fork-motor-nature-trail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail</a>，还有Cades Cove Scenic Drive的入口（到的时候刚好黄昏，刚关门。。）</li><li><strong>Day 5</strong>也就是今天，早上送了驴友去Knoxville机场，我回Gatlinburg来写博客啦。</li></ul><p>这个行程，怎么说呢，我觉得安排的不怎么样，因为太赶了。什么行程会比较好呢，翻到后面有详细的……</p><p>再算算花费，这次因为和驴友用的Splitwise，所以基本上什么花了多少钱都有记录。</p><ul><li>租车：带各种保险等等，共<strong>$855.38</strong></li><li>油：四箱油不到，共<strong>$85.2</strong></li><li>三餐：我没带收据，不过每顿大概15刀吧，不过最后一顿为了庆祝吃了顿人均$60的大餐。几天下来我一个人估计大概不到<strong>$150</strong></li><li>零食和水：<strong>$63.24</strong></li><li>酒店：5晚上共<strong>$676.51</strong></li></ul><p>所以不算机票，我这趟大概花了<strong>一千刀</strong>吧。比预算的多好多，应该主要是租车的保险太贵了，焦急的期待着我成为租车不用买配套保险的老司机的那天😂</p><p><img src="/images/cades-cove.jpg" alt="Cades Cove"></p><p>好了，上干货。</p><h4 id="衣"><a href="#衣" class="headerlink" title="衣"></a>衣</h4><p>这次出门，每天上身穿贴身内衣+毛衣+冲锋衣外套，下面穿单裤。带了个可以外穿的无袖羊毛衣备用。感觉是在Shennandoah NP完全hold不住，因为海拔偏高所以比体感温度冷不少，出车门拍两张照片手就冰的不行，于是我喊了一天要买手套……（然而到最后也没买）。离开Shennandoah NP就好很多，基本上毛衣加贴身就可以搞定海拔不高的地方。海拔高的地方比如Clingmans Dome，穿了外套也会觉得冷，但还算忍得住，不至于想逃回车上。有时候徒步身上会散热，这时候基本上连毛衣都不需要，贴身加外套搞定一切。</p><p>另外，好像我们走过的所有登山道，即使是被评为Easy难度的，道上乱七八糟东西都很多，穿厚底鞋是必须的……</p><h4 id="食-amp-住"><a href="#食-amp-住" class="headerlink" title="食 &amp; 住"></a>食 &amp; 住</h4><p>提前一个月在Booking.com上订的住宿。考虑过国家公园里的木屋，因为发现好像都订满而作罢。不过其实这样也挺好，毕竟白天都已经在山里了，晚上出来感受一下美国大南方的小镇生活也蛮惬意的。</p><p>在Shennandoah NP附近搜酒店住宿什么的，好像很难搜到很近的。不太明白为啥冒出了一大堆Charlottesville的listing，明明开车进山要一个小时的啊好吗！剩下的好酒店好像就都在Harrisonburg了。住的酒店就在James Madison Univ旁边，开车进园大概半个小时。蛮古朴的一个小镇，风格和我们大Lexington不是一般的像，也有一两家还比较文艺或者上档次的餐厅，非常推荐没来过大维州的人来感受下～</p><p>在大烟山这一片直接住Gatlinburg，简直是教科书级别的旅游镇，整条街搞的跟个高密度迪士尼公园似的连摩天轮都有……因此在这里可以满足很多生活上的需求，补给必需品啊吃好餐厅啊体验夜生活啊什么的，而且开车进山才五分多钟，唯一的缺点就是塞车塞得太厉害。这里推荐一家brunch——<a href="https://crockettsbreakfastcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crockett’s Breakfast Camp.</a> 谷歌评分4.8，我吃了他们家的scrambled eggs quesadilla, 浓郁而不油不腻，超级好吃😋<br><img src="/images/quesadilla.jpg" alt="Scrambled Eggs Quesadilla">插播一句，毕业那次和父母来大烟山住的Pigeon Forge，远很多而且什么都没有！能住Gatlinburg千万不要舍近求远啊啊啊啊</p><p>Blue Ridge Pkwy上最大的俩城市是Roanoke, VA和Asheville, NC尤其后者，不过这两个地方一个太靠近起点另一个太靠近终点，像我们这种只在Blue Ridge Pkwy上只住一天的人来讲很难安排，于是我们选择住在刚进北卡时的Blowing Rock。这样下来能吃的选择就少了很多，反正评分高点的都是吃了上火的东西……所以，多买水果，多买水果，多买水果！</p><p>另外，还吃了这家餐厅——<a href="https://oldemill.net/maples-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maples Restaurant</a>。东西本身不咋好吃，不过气氛非常赞。主要是，这家店周围方圆几个mile，连户人家都看不到，突然冒出这么高档的餐厅，还挺有情调的……</p><p>住的这几个酒店吧，双人间大概都是每晚$100左右。给我感觉条件都不怎么样，重点是房间里都非常非常干😂</p><h4 id="行：自驾篇"><a href="#行：自驾篇" class="headerlink" title="行：自驾篇"></a>行：自驾篇</h4><p>这次奢侈了一把从Hertz租的车，各类保险贵的想哭，不到三百的Base rental加上各类服务费和保护费以后要$855，当然能在Knoxville还车的车行也不多所以我们也没什么更便宜的选择就是了……Hertz口碑一直是业界第一，不过我这趟下来其实也没什么好评价的。好事儿，这证明我一路上没出啥事儿……</p><p>租的车是一辆Nissan Versa。非常靠谱，挑不出任何毛病，成功hold住了我和我小伙伴不敢恭维的车技和因此开上的各种烂路窄路草坪台阶。也还算比较省油，共1045迈的路程，总共加了不到4箱油。一定要点名表扬一个！</p><p>路很弯很绕，关键是晚上没车，开起来真的瘆得慌。Blue Ridge Pkwy路面情况非常好，不过很多漂亮的小岔路都很破很烂。而且有一些比较热门的步道没地方停车，车只能停到附近草丛里，于是对底盘要求有点高。如果我之后还要来的话，可能保险起见还是会租SUV…</p><p><img src="/images/nissan.jpg" alt="Nissan Versa"></p><p>PS：这车真不是我们在纽约租的😂</p><h4 id="行：摄影篇"><a href="#行：摄影篇" class="headerlink" title="行：摄影篇"></a>行：摄影篇</h4><p>翻了几张自己比较满意的照片，发现焦段大部分在100-240这个区间，有两张真的是240。现在想了想，我去很多地方拍自然风光好像都是拉比较长的大长焦——毕竟在自然环境下拍照，很多时候你无法走近你要拍的主体（比如拍什么河对岸啊或者隔壁山头的树和房子），所以都得靠拉焦距来体现主体。这次自驾，值得拍的东西大概是以下几类——</p><ol><li>隔壁山头被树包围的房子/石头/大烟山云雾什么的，这里点名Looking Glass Overlook。这种一定要上超级大长焦，越长越好</li><li>湖和湖边的树和房子，点名Mabry Mills。这种因为离得近，还很适合拍个美女什么的，所以大概100mm左右焦距是坠吼的。<br><img src="/images/peak-of-otter.jpg" alt="Peak of the Otter"></li><li>小溪和小瀑布，这一路上真的全都是。拍了好几张，发现拍小溪小瀑布好像只有特写比较容易构图，全景我真的拍不好啊，两边的树乱七八糟的实在不适合构图，不知道网上那些小溪瀑布全景图都是怎么拍那么好看的！</li><li>弯弯曲曲的路（很可惜，这个如果能航拍的话会好看很多）</li></ol><p>综上所述，如果一定要带定焦/小变焦的话，我会带两个镜头，一个85一个200以上。很抱歉，我现在其实还没图。按照我的习惯，是要从外面回家一个星期以后再开始倒照片修图才会比较客观😂</p><h4 id="行：路线篇"><a href="#行：路线篇" class="headerlink" title="行：路线篇"></a>行：路线篇</h4><p>前面说了觉得这次行程安排得并不好，主要原因是太赶了，跑这么多地方四天真的不够啊，Blue Ridge Pkwy本身就得至少三天，更别说一头一尾两大国家公园了。可是当我思考多少天合适的时候发现了另一个问题——那就是，这一路看到的风景，其实挺雷同的……玩到第四天真的有点审美疲劳。作为一个不太分得清各种树木只是喜欢拍拍颜色的人来讲，好像真的没必要玩那么多天。</p><p>所以想了想，纯粹从拍风光大片的角度来考虑的话，最好的行程应该是——跳过弗吉尼亚部分，直接从Blowing Rock一路穿过北卡去大烟山。这样的话大概也是玩三四天——</p><ul><li>第一天从Blowing Rock开到Asheville，走走Grandfather Mountain，看看Linn Cove Viaduct，玩玩Linville Falls，好像也就差不多了。</li><li>第二天Asheville开到大烟山的Gatlinburg，可以拍拍Looking Glass——这个我觉得真的好看！然后据说Milepost 469那一块真的特别值得花时间好好玩儿，我们这趟直接高速跳过去了😂</li><li>第三天大烟山，441号公路主要景点可以刷一遍什么Clingsman Dome啊New found gap啊还可以找个什么步道走走，再推荐一个不走寻常路的Roaring Fork Nature Motor trail. 这个trail尤其适合不爱hiking的懒人死宅，因为给我感觉基本上就是开车开出爬山的体验。。。</li><li>第四天可以玩玩大烟山一些比较远的地方例如Cades Cove还有Balsam Mt。Cades Cove那个景观路我觉得算是必玩项目，然而从Gatlinburg开车过去要一个小时呢。</li></ul><p>嗯，我是以非常沉痛的心情得出以上结论的。这次真的不得不承认，我们大弗吉尼亚的风光真是被北卡完完全全的秒杀……植被的丰富性风景的多样性还有秋天的颜色鲜艳程度北卡都完胜，就连黑熊都只在大烟山出没而不去Shennandoah. 当然也不是说我们弗吉尼亚不值得来啦，北卡走下来一圈，觉得小镇小村什么的还是远远没有弗吉尼亚那些历史重镇有韵味啊（不给大VA挽个尊，心里还是不平衡……）</p><hr><p>最后说了那么多照片照片，我还是并没有放什么大片，本文配的所有图都是iPhone 8摄影作品……嗯，敬请期待<strong>《崽儿流浪记 之 回南记·自驾摄影篇（二）》</strong>！另外明天出去爬三天山，祝我这平时不咋运动的小身板儿不会被累死……</p>]]></content>

      自从四年前本科毕业带着家人走了一趟Blue Ridge Pkwy和大烟山以后，就一直想秋季再回来一趟。毕竟在Appalachians Mountains呆了四年，每年秋天都会望着山里一层红一层黄一层白的山色思考人生，而那时唯一的遗憾就是当时不会开车，没有机会真正进山区好好体验一下拍个照。今年秋天回来一趟，算是弥补了几年来的遗憾，也算是排遣一下对美国大南方的乡愁了。

说来奇怪，好像越是闭塞保守的地方，越容易给我带来“乡愁感”——明明在那里的时候拼了命的想逃出来，逃出来以后也不会想再回去生活，但每当想到的时候，还是觉得记忆中的那段岁月那片土地是温柔的。

我果真是怀旧的巨蟹座啊。

行程大概是这

      感觉已经很久，很久，很久没有像学生时代一样，写一篇流水账说说自己最近做了什么吧。想了想，我现在生活怎么都应该比学生时代更充实才对啊。但是可能也确实是很久没有这么被死线在背后追了。

嗯，反正这段时间是挺忙的，导致我脑子里一直回响着Wake me up when September ends这首歌，真的很想一觉睡到国庆节了。

8月份结束了夏季学期的课，两个月没看书没做作业的我意外的被杨超越保送及格了，关键是14个选择题竟然完全靠蒙对了13个……秋季学期的课，难不难我不好讲，但是真的非常花时间。每周要交作业，每个月要交论文。我倒是觉得这种project heavy (as opposed to

      好不容易忙完一段，来写个博散散心。最近不知道为什么，发现自己好像经常提到13岁时候发生的一件有趣的小事，于是在这里记一下。

初一升初二那年暑假我13岁，和H参加了深圳日报组的美国游学夏令营。整个夏令营大概二三十号人，三个带团老师带着一票从小学四年级到高三不等的学生，不知为啥里面至少六成不是在上初一就是在上高一。

我和H在报道那天认识了同样结伴来报名的两个初一妹子，这里叫P和A吧，为什么说巧呢是因为她俩小学的时候分别和我和H认识（P是H小学同班同学，A和我小学一起上过课外班……）。毫无疑问，我们四个从整个团在报社集合那一刻就开始抱团行动，并且在下了飞机的第一天就认识了小团体的第一个外敌——同

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>写之前先感谢北美推特中文圈东西海岸两大教主——越南面教主@charliechou 和Soylent教主 @jnozsc。要不是看到你们惊人的减肥成果，要不是听你们在博客里或者饭局上分享各种具体的减肥经验，我觉得我当时真的下不了减肥这个决心。虽然我这份减肥经验和你们的肯定不一样，很不健康，很政治不正确，但是既然减下来了，就要给你们三鞠躬。</p><hr><p>2014年，本科毕业，105斤。</p><p>毕业之前最后一次称体重称出了这个数儿，毕业后就去Charlottesville菜师傅家住了。刚搬过去的时候他没有买秤，我应该也没有想到过我这辈子居然会有达到130斤哭着要减肥的一天，于是一直在快乐的吃吃吃喝喝喝，然后一天一天看着肚子上的肉开始一层又一层叠了起来……叠到三层那一天，天天因为长太肥被黑的某人，指着我那结婚蛋糕似的肚子，竟然忍不住笑出来了……于是终于找到一个秤上去一幺——120斤。</p><p>2015年，开始纽漂，126斤。</p><p>那句俗话怎么说来着，“近猪者吃”？我一直以为是因为某人厨艺好饭量大给我带坏了，于是次年四月回了国听我家里唠叨了一个月让我减肥，五月份去纽约入职，我心里还是很无所谓的——不跟饭桶住在一起，体重自然会慢慢减下来的，不着急。因为这份盲（自）目（我）自（麻）信（痹），以及不想给自己添堵，所以还是一直没买秤。到这个时候我还是很鄙视那些每天为了要减肥只吃一片菜叶子，明明瘦的像道闪电还天天嚷嚷自己肥的女生（以及男生，嗯），觉得这些审美被各类媒体和广告绑架的人实在是愚蠢——谁规定的瘦才好看，请君自问没有丰满的杨贵妃怎么会有长恨歌和安史之乱？再者，纽约有太多弗吉尼亚找不到的好餐馆，我简直就跟刘姥姥进大观园一样连吃个茄子都觉得新鲜，体重神马的早就抛到九霄云外去了。</p><p>2016年，回国北漂，130斤。</p><p>本着不想给自己添堵的心理，我还是没有买秤。不过到了16年年底，正准备出个小远门，突然发烧了。去医院抽血开药的时候看到一个称，站了上去一看居然有130斤，我被吓的完全不敢相信。后来回深圳的时候偷偷拿家里的秤幺了一下，叹气——自我安慰很久的“秤可能坏了”，从此再也不管用了。</p><p>2017年，回到纽约，124斤，决定好好减肥。</p><p>虽然和实在受不了每次回家都被爹妈混合双打也有很大关系，但最终下决心要减肥主要是两个原因——<br>  1.真的买不到合适的牛仔裤了；<br>  2.体检检出了高血糖。再不控制，只怕才24岁就要得糖尿病了😂</p><hr><p>决定了减肥，就要具体定计划了。</p><p>首先定目标——我还挺满意我大学时候的105斤的状态的，那就先把目标定在110吧，剩下那5斤“到时候再说”。很高兴的是，我现在已经可以开始计划引号部分了。</p><p>应该说17年的时候看了陈永仁的减肥经——<a href="https://www.ameinikan.com/blog/2017/04/15/my-work-out-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">《不是尽力是一定要做到，3 个月减肥 20+ kg》</a>——我就大概心里有底，只要有毅力坚持“饮食控制，运动消耗”，短时间内达到这个目标问题并不是天方夜谭。但是问题来了，就是我非常清楚，我这人……没，有，毅，力。</p><p>我非常清楚，毅力这玩意儿真不是说有就能有的，没毅力的话只能把动力转化成毅力了。而“不得糖尿病”这个动力对于我这个年龄的人，说实话真的有点远，而像很多其他姑娘想要的什么马甲线A4腰，我也真的并没有太大兴趣。所以我思来想去，终于列了个基本不需要毅力的减肥计划，总结成一句话就是——</p><p><strong>以毒攻毒，用自己懒得吃饭的惰性，把自己饿瘦。</strong></p><ol><li>坚持吃一顿早餐（这条只坚持了一个月……），中午饭不要顾忌随便吃，晚饭除非是有重要社交活动，否则不吃肉不吃碳水，甚至直接不吃</li><li>过午不吃零食，不喝饮料，液体只喝水和茶</li><li>每周严格控制摄入的酒量（这个一开始没有，是今年3月份加的）</li></ol><p>大家有没有发现一点——这里完全没有提到运动。我真的非，常，讨，厌，去健身房。在多吃多动和少吃少动里面，我这种懒得惊天地泣鬼神，为了不起床可以一泡尿憋两个小时的人，肯定是选择少吃少动的。</p><p>当然，作为一个热爱到处下餐馆的吃货，能尽量不要“少吃”也是最好的。于是我遵循了17年感恩节和查理大大面基时候他说的一个要点——早上尽量能多吃就多吃，晚上尽量能少吃就少吃。乐观主义者如我对于这句话的理解则是——每天还是有两顿饭是可以放开了吃的！</p><p>这整个计划，政治非常不正确有木有？？？</p><p>计划做好的我，马上就开始执行了。以为这个计划不太需要什么毅力就能执行好的，后来发现——确实不太需要什么毅力。不过3个月20公斤的神话是不用考虑的了，想看到成果还是需要一定耐心的，慢慢减掉快20斤并且能稳定下来，大概花了半年。</p><p>真正实践起来发现其实第2条是最重要的，估计也是我之前三年横向长得如此疯狂的原因。毕竟技术公司的零食果汁永远无限供应，每次只吃一点点也不会有饱腹感，日积月累就不知道吃了多少糖了。</p><hr><p>2017.12，126斤。</p><p>这个时候的我计划执行的非常严格，但是也确实比较痛苦。毕竟吃了三年零食喝了三年果汁谈了个饭量是正常人三倍大的男朋友，让我晚饭就吃两片我特别讨厌的生菜叶子，真的是会饿哭的。大概在这个月我学到了一个简单实用的技能：拿马克杯和微波炉做茶碗蒸，每天晚上只要饿了就会蒸一个，蒸完了撒点葱加上一滴香油一茶匙酱油就非常好吃了。然而家里并不是时时刻刻都有葱（我自己不做饭，买了葱也吃不完，所以一般都是蹭室友的），连葱都没有的时候我只能靠不停的喝水/茶找饱腹感了。</p><p>月底去了趟厄瓜多尔，因为有驴友一起，所以也没办法“不吃晚饭”，我也很高兴找到了放开吃又不“犯规”的机会。好在那段时间基本上是全天候的浮潜，每天运动量还挺大的，所以也不至于有什么罪恶感。</p><p>2018.1，116斤。</p><p>这个时候我终于买了秤。因为从曼哈顿的公司公寓搬家到了皇后区，所以上班时间变晚了一些。家附近有个地方卖bagels，搬过去的头两天真的会每天去买个bagel当早餐。结果发现走路和坐地铁的时候因为身体在运动状态，完全没有胃口吃早餐，等我到了办公室开始缓过劲儿觉得饿了的时候已经中午了，于是这个bagel就变成午餐了。从这个时候开始，我决定把“早餐”这个环节省略掉，换成了在公司附近的抹茶店/咖啡店买一杯带全脂奶的饮品，喝完了饱腹感也很强，但不至于影响午餐。除此以外，我似乎失去了对零食果汁和碳酸饮料的兴趣——有很多次很多次，我走到公司厨房，看了一圈零食饮料甚至啤酒，最后咽咽口水，两手空空回到工位。大概是个什么心情呢，就是很怀念之前喝饮料吃零食的快乐，可是一想象到再重新吃这些东西，嘴里一股腻乎乎的糖味儿，就会觉得很对不起自己一个月不吃晚饭的努力。</p><p>2018.2，112斤。</p><p>喜出望外，觉得只差两斤就能达到目标了，终于可以跟自己跟爸妈交代了，喜大普奔！喜极而泣！好好庆祝！既然晚上不方便吃饭的话，我就去喝酒吧！于是春节那一周我基本每天下了班都会找个酒吧喝两杯，一鼓作气打卡了非常多想去的酒吧，非常开心。到了周末请同事们来家里过年包饺子，结果馅儿买多了，最后连着吃了快四天饺子，还送了一大堆出去。不到一个星期就悲剧了……</p><p>2018.3，120斤。</p><p>是的，连着喝了一周酒又吃了四天饺子，我一周内飙升8斤，肚子上的游泳圈就在我眼皮底下又鼓起来一环。还差两斤就达到目标结果功败垂成，我当时真的是气急败坏。于是总结了一下，觉得说不准跟喝酒有关系——乙醇不就是葡萄糖酿出来的么？于是之后开始控制每周摄入的酒量：没有局的情况下一周两杯；有局的情况下，那一周另外六天都不要碰酒精。同时，因为怕饿瘦的太快也容易反弹的快，加上在公司附近发现了比较好吃的生菜沙拉和三明治，在家附近发现了好吃的蟹柳沙拉，于是我开始恢复正常吃晚饭。当然，真吃的时候还是会很注意，首先尽量不油不盐（不过量的淀粉和清淡的肉类都会吃），其次尽量只吃到半饱。感觉效果还不错，很稳定，之后再也没疯狂反弹过。</p><p>2018.4，118斤；2018.5，115斤；2018.6，112斤。大概这段时间开始有不少人跟我说，哎某崽你瘦了好多～</p><p>2018.7，110斤。</p><p>昨天加今天称了3次，一次111一次110一次109.6斤。终于达到原定目标，感觉没白饿半年肚子了。</p><p>而从4月开始我能感受到的变化是——饭量真的变少了，以前我午饭能吃10块鸡翅现在吃5个已经顶天了；以前晚上能干掉整碗越南面，现在每次吃到很撑了还剩下半碗汤。大腿也确实细溜了，以前龇牙咧嘴才能把腿塞进去才能把扣子系上的牛仔裤，现在轻轻松松随便穿。身材好不好看我不在乎，但喜欢的衣服都能找到合适的码数还是很开心的。</p><p>饭量变少的同时，因为一直少油少盐，所以口味变得越来越清淡了。现在和饭友们出去吃饭，不止一次他们觉得好吃的东西我会觉得太油或太咸，而这种事情在我回北京之前基本没有发生过。</p><p>因为吃的一直都清淡，所以感觉胃也变差了，至少拉肚子的次数明显比以前多😂借用Emily Blunt在Devil Wears Prada里的台词，I’m just one stomach flu away from my goal weight…</p><p>不过比较惨的是，现在每次进超市，都会看一圈零食却没动力买。甚至有时候努力暗示自己“哎呀你都一个月没吃零食了，奖励自己买一包吧”都没用，一想到吃一小块巧克力就可能造成我饿自己半年的成果可能尽数白费就充满了罪恶感。但是我看着这些零食也确实会流口水，因为知道它们真的都好吃啊……</p><p>最奇葩的是……因为不敢吃零食，所以现在每次饿的时候你知道我最想吃家里的什么吗？</p><p>答：猫粮。。。。。。。。。一看就又香又脆又健康，真的好想尝一尝。之所以到现在还没吃，主要是怕一开始吃就停不下来。。。。。。</p><hr><p>于是，一个好吃懒做讨厌运动的死宅，终于因为连饭都懒得吃，成功在半年内瘦了快20斤。下一个目标，回到本科时的105。毕竟现在好不容易养成了不吃零食不喝饮料的习惯，蛮不容易的。感谢在这个过程中所有夸过我“啊你真的瘦了”的人！</p><p>全剧终。彩蛋部分大家有奖竞猜一下，请问黄某崽什么时候会吃她的第一口猫粮呢？让我们拭目以待！</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>上中学以来和很多人说过自己以前有自闭症。迄今为止，还没有人的第一反应是相信的。</p><p>大概都是这样的——“你这么外向？还自闭？”“你要是都自闭我这算啥？”“开啥玩笑呢。”</p><p>所以，以生日为契机，给能读到这篇博的朋友们科普一下自闭症谱系，顺便也做一下每个人每年生日都会做的事情——回顾一下自己的人生吧。</p><p>毕竟，能平平安安快快乐乐过上26岁生日，对于自闭症谱系人群，好像也不是那么容易的事呢。</p><h1 id="Preface"><a href="#Preface" class="headerlink" title="Preface"></a>Preface</h1><p>也就是一年内吧，我做了个梦。梦到了和我6岁时候的我自己面对面。她剪了个短短的小碎发（小时候我妈不给我留长头发），别了一头乱七八糟颜色的发夹，小嘴有点撅起来。她和其他的孩子们一起在玩猫捉老鼠什么的，玩的也挺开心的，似乎和周围的孩子并没有任何不同。只是不知道是哪些细节就像是玫瑰花上的小刺，梦里我能很清楚的感受到，这个萝莉并没有融入其他孩子的游戏，也融入不了。和其他人互动着的她，似乎更像是在和她自己的小宇宙中一群看不见的人一起玩着猫和老鼠，而和真正在她周围的小朋友们，总保持着一种模糊的距离感。</p><p>发现她身上那股子孤僻的时候，成年的我浑身如电流穿过般颤栗着，差点湿了眼眶。说起来很像脑残偶像剧，但是当时真的突然很想保护很想疼爱这个小萝莉一辈子。当然同时我也知道，这个孩子好像不喜欢被人保护。我只是希望，她能一辈子生活在她自己这个强大的小宇宙中，不要改变，不能改变。</p><p>记得当时我走了过去，她怪怪地看着我——可能很少见到我这种怪阿姨似乎有那么点知道她在想什么吧。那一瞬间我想把她抱在怀里，我有很多很多话想跟她说。我想告诉她，你这一生必然不会平坦，你会认识很多很多不喜欢你的人，你会被警告很多很多次不要说错话不要做错事，你会思考很多很多遍自己到底哪里做错了，自己到底哪里和其他人不一样。你会自我怀疑很多很多年，是不是只有努力变成另外一个什么人，才能和这个世界和解。而且这些问题的答案，可能一辈子都找不到。但是你放心，你没有变，你带着各种大大小小的伤口长这么大，但你内心一直没有变。</p><p>后来，今年六一儿童节，我妈把好不容易修好的家庭小视频发给了我——两分钟的视频，两岁不到的我听着音乐尬舞，完全无视周围逗娃逗得起劲的大人们，仿佛身处一个平行世界。和梦里见到的那个孩子一模一样。这段视频对我触动太大，我立马就买了那本”A Complete Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome”，花了两周时间终于读完，一边读一边对号入座，无尽感慨，五味杂陈。</p><p>还记得和孙师傅面基。饭桌上她说，当医生明确的告知她有抑郁症的时候，她的反应竟然是兴奋和开心。当时的我完全无法理解，她说就好像卢平教授怎么解释哈利面对摄魂怪——“你恐惧的是恐惧本身。”当我今年儿童节那天意识到自己好像确实还在自闭症谱系上的时候我突然理解她了，因为我的反应是一样的——开心和释然。终于有望和自己和解。</p><p>那些莫名其妙就说错了的话，莫名其妙就做错了的事，那段莫名其妙被嘲讽被孤立的成长历程，突然一下就找到了想了很久很久的原因，而且这个原因并不是因为我做的不够好。恰好相反，我现在能够和这个世界和睦相处并且为自己的生活负责，是因为我足够勇敢足够努力足够棒，在全世界都在对我施行冷暴力的时候我硬生生撑了过来，撑到了我有反击能力的今天。</p><p>一直想找个Neurophycologist确诊一下自己现在算不算自闭症谱系人群，也确实周围打听了一下，发现做个诊断要上千块钱。花这么多钱做一件并不会改变我人生的事情，我多少有点舍不得，于是这个计划暂时搁浅。其实有没有一个确切的诊断，可能已经不重要了吧。</p><h1 id="What-is-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder"><a href="#What-is-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder" class="headerlink" title="What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?"></a>What is Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h1><p><em>我最大的特点就是我任何社交行为都来源于记忆力和智力，而非直觉。换言之，阿斯伯格综合征人士最大的特点就是缺乏社会直觉，社交场合中什么鸡毛蒜皮的事都需要动用智力来处理，因为需要过脑子，所以处理得比普通人慢。</em></p><p>——来自<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/28396729/answer/210919498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">知乎匿名用户</a></p><p>大概意思就是，如果普通人是人，那么阿斯伯格，或者高功能自闭症，就是人工智能。</p><p>“阿斯伯格综合征”这个概念被最近的自闭症谱系诊断对照标准给剔除了，因为和高功能自闭症重合很多。目前临床学好像也不太确定阿斯伯格和高功能自闭症到底是不是完全是一回事儿，不过目前很多人已经把这两个概念互相替代使用了。</p><p>具体症状怎么样呢，我从维基百科上抄了一下自闭症谱系障碍标准第五版—— 1) 社交沟通及社会互动上的缺损 2) 固定的兴趣及重复的行为。之前的第四版里面还有一个标准是语言方面有缺陷（也就是学说话学的晚），这么说来我是中枪很深了。</p><p>大概看看我有哪些方面是中枪的——以下是我读”A Complete Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome”时候的高亮部分：</p><ul><li>There can be a delay of several years in the occurrence of romantic experiences, and a lack of progress in the ‘dating game’ compared to peers.</li><li>After many hours in intensive programs to encourage communication abilities, the problem is no longer encouraging the child to speak, but encouraging him or her to talk less, listen and be more aware of the social context.</li><li>In a group setting, the person’s intellectual capacity may not be sufficient to cope with the social interaction of several participants, and the person may take longer to process social information that is normally communicated more quickly in a group than individually… several others join in, the person with Asperger’s syndrome becomes quiet and does not participate as actively and fluently as when the conversation was between just the two of us.</li><li>Children with Asperger’s syndrome often enjoy watching the same movie many times. （《还珠格格》台词你给我提个头我能给你把整整一集背下来……）</li><li>I have found that when the child discovers the intellectual and social value of being imaginative, the level of creativity can be astounding. （我小学同学都知道我从小就喜欢在作业本上写小说哈哈哈哈哈）</li><li>Girls with Asperger’s syndrome can develop a special interest in reading fiction. （看到这一句我直接蹦起来了……）</li><li>Sometimes happiness is expressed in an immature or unusual way, such as literally jumping for joy or flapping hands excitedly.</li><li>The child or adult with Asperger’s syndrome may only have two (emotional) settings, between one and two, and nine and ten.</li><li>While the person with Asperger’s syndrome can have considerable difficulty talking about emotions, there can be a greater eloquence and insight when expressing his or her emotions typing an e-mail, writing a diary or composing a poem.</li><li>The third most common interest is public transport systems.

If the diagnostic news is broadcast widely, there will inevitably be some children or adults who misuse this disclosure to torment and despise the person with Asperger’s syndrome.</em></p><p>我出生的时候户口注册到了深圳园岭我外公外婆家，因为当时园岭小学是深圳头号名牌小学。结果后来因为学说话太晚智力发育的也太晚，我妈就担心我上了小学跟不上。她还咨询过深圳的特殊学校问收不收自闭症儿童，结果特殊学校表示只收聋哑人，我这种她是不收的。我妈只好托关系把我送到家附近的小学，好不容易赚到的学区房户口算是白费了。</p><p>我自己已经不记得第一天上小学是怎么回事了，后来还是我妈复述的——上课的时候不知道好好听，下了课以后课间一过，再上课的时候就坐到别人的位置上去了。诸如此类的事故发生了几次后老师非常头疼，第二天就给家里打电话告状了。于是过了几天中秋节，我妈跑去送了老师一盒月饼，和老师解释了一下状况，老师恍然大悟。</p><p>老师姓王，当时应该是个刚毕业的专科生，一个二十岁左右的小姐姐，素颜挺好看的又温柔，毕业后好多同学说起她还是各种赞美和怀念。然而我却一直对她无法释怀——她应该是我小学毕业之前最伤我自尊的人，没有之一。</p><p>王老师在知道我的情况以后，可能是对我要求没那么严了，我也不记得。然后过一段时间吧，班里要选12个人进少先队，投票表决，我和另一个小朋友并列第12. 这时候她对大家说，那我们就选黄某崽吧，黄某崽四岁半才学会说话，我们需要鼓励鼓励她。</p><p>我当时没什么感觉，挺高兴的，毕竟当时也算是个小粉红，能戴上红领巾还是挺光荣的。然而到了后来，有很多其他小朋友因为我学说话学的太晚而嘲笑我。不知道如何还击的我，慢慢也开始觉得这么晚学说话真的是一件很丢脸的事情。后来到了五年级六年级，我学习成绩好又经常在文体活动中抛头露面的，终于摆脱了学说话太晚带来的自卑感，于是我意识到一点——不能怪我的同学们嘲笑我，因为小孩子就是不懂事；要怪，只能怪王老师一点面子都不给我留，她堂而皇之地地在全班同学面前因为“四岁半才学会说话”而同情我，红领巾则变成了过路人对乞丐的施舍的那几毛钱，让我想到这件事情就觉得非常难堪。</p><p>这件事的直接后果就是，整个小学加初中，我都觉得有自闭症这件事情很羞耻，不仅不会和其他人说，连自己都觉得无法面对。</p><p>其他后果就是，我能够敏锐的感觉到，从始至终，王老师就没有尊重过我。我小学时候的成绩一直不错，而且因为很喜欢在文娱活动上出风头，老师们都很喜欢我。唯独这位王老师，不管我是成绩上进步了还是表现好了，她都从来没有表扬过我。也没有批评过，只是能感觉到那种轻视，我也解释不清楚。别人英语考得好就是成绩有进步，我英语考得好就是偏科（我数学也考得好，语文没考好因为是她教……）就说我四年级和班里其他几个同学加入了合唱队吧，她对其他合唱队的同学就很多表扬，对于我则是，“加入了合唱队连字都不会写了”（吐槽我字丑……其实真的还好，只是有点一个大一个小而已）后来我终于靠层层选拔考试被深外录取了，拿到录取通知书时最想做的事情就是，找到王老师（当时已经离开我们学校了）然后把录取通知书甩她脸上，看她还敢不敢轻视我。</p><hr><p><em>– Many adults who are diagnosed in their mature years say that the first time they felt different to others was when they started school.</em></p><p>我大概上小学一年级的时候，就有那么点模模糊糊的觉得好像我哪根筋确实是搭错的，但是一直没有得出“我和别人不一样”的结论，因为没有人这么告诉过我，而我当时也没有足够的智商和时间和情绪好好思考这些问题。还有一个最重要的原因是，那时候我的社交障碍还没有到会影响我心情的程度。</p><p>刚上小学的时候，确实经常闹笑话，也确实经常被欺负。举个例子，10个人玩手心手背的时候，另外9个人会当着我面凑在一起商量大家一起出手背（我当然是听不见的）然后派一个人过来骗我出手心。坚信大家都不会撒谎的我会真的乖乖的出手心，然后就只能当猫捉老鼠中抓不到老鼠的那只猫。至于我为什么坚信大家都不会撒谎呢，是因为觉得“诶你们大家没读过《狼来了》之类的故事吗，这些故事里面说了撒谎的后果很严重的你们应该也会怕的吧……”至于被那些比我大几个月的同学说“大人说话小孩不要偷听”，更是家常便饭。所以那时候我特别期待长大，等我长大一岁就可以听“大人”说话了，虽然等到那时候“大人”们也长大了一岁……</p><p>不过好在那时候我并不是一个人，班里有另外一两个女生也是被集体群嘲的对象，基本上都是些家穷人丑说话带着乡下口音的小姑娘。我私下里和她们都玩的不错，但是也有很多次自私的为了集体归属感，和其他同学们一起群嘲她们。现在想一想，倒是非常能理解那时候的自己，不过总觉得还是欠她们一个对不起。</p><p>而我上小学的时候——我不知道是只有我们小学这样还是全中国的小学都这样——在小学五年级之前，班里的小团体被严格的划分为“男生”和“女生”，男生头儿是成绩垫底的顽劣少年，而女生头儿是成绩优异的班干部。男生和女生之间有如隔了楚汉之河，永远势不两立。因此并不可能出现全班同学同时欺负某一个同学这种事情——一旦男生开始欺负哪个女生，一定会有其他女生上来帮她。所以，大概上二年级三年级的时候，我最好的几个女生朋友，都是那些会挡在我前面和欺负我的那几个男生掐架的小姐姐们。至于那几个男生都对我干了啥，我现在想想其实还挺有意思——印象最深的了两个是“对着我打弹弓”和“冲着我吹气球”。我从小就害怕“弹弓”和“气球”这种弹性很大的东西，因为被弹弓弹出的石子打到会很疼，而气球被吹爆的“嘭”一声我特别受不了。现在我26岁了，见到气球还是会战战兢兢绕着走，也不知道是小时候被那些臭男生欺负留下的心理阴影，还是因为害怕弹弓和气球所以才会被欺负，无所谓了。</p><p>也闹过很多其他笑话，毕竟反应慢，总是被人摆一道。印象最深的还是和我这位王老师有关。班里要去参加合唱比赛，说好的统一穿背带裤，于是每个人都带了背带裤来。快开始比赛了，老师就直接在教室里说大家在这换衣服啊。其他同学都扭扭捏捏的不肯动，只有我一个人当场就把上衣全脱了，然后全班小孩子看着上半身全裸的我哈哈大笑。我到今天都没想明白，为什么其他人六七岁的时候就知道当众脱衣服很羞耻呢？</p><p>尽管经常被欺负的挺惨的，小学六年我人缘竟然一直还不赖。毕竟有几个女生会帮我去对付班里男生，还有几个被针对的比我还惨的人和我算是团结在了一起，而且我成绩好又守纪律也很招老师喜欢。关键是我还有一个只有自闭儿童才有的绝活儿——可以记住所有人的生日。对，就像你们电视里看到的背圆周率能背到100多位的自闭症儿童一样，我小学的时候差不多记得全班同学的生日，然后每次聊天说到“噢你生日我记得是9月28号对吧”就能把对方感动的涕泪横流。（说到这个绝活儿……我到现在还能一个不落背下来初中全班同学的学号，小学的背不下来是因为每个学期都会变😂）</p><p>到了五年级六年级，开始有人跟我说，你很乐观，你和其他人不一样。当时的我，刚跟着学校合唱队载誉而归，又是学校重点培养考重点初中的对象，正值春风得意，对于这种评价是很引以为豪的，相信说我不一样的都是在夸我。</p><p>现在想想，2003-04年和2015-16年，算是我二十几年人生中，过的最自信的两个人生阶段了。</p><h3 id="Adolescence"><a href="#Adolescence" class="headerlink" title="Adolescence"></a>Adolescence</h3><p><em>– Memories of being bullied, misunderstood, blamed or betrayed can intrude on their thoughts as an everyday experience, many years after the event occured.

He said, ‘I knew she was upset, but I didn’t want to do the wrong thing.’</em></p><p>自从初中毕业，我和我妈每逢寒暑假就会跟我爸和他的同事们出去爬山涉水。以前和我爸的同事们接触的少，爸妈就也没发现什么。一家三口开始一起和其他大人们接触后，我说的话做的事好像每次都让我父母非常尴尬而我浑然不觉甚至觉得他们“想太多”。没有“眼力价儿”该搭把手帮忙的时候毫无意识是经常有的事儿，有时候和别人聊天无意识的就开始说自己学校的老师同学们，也感受不到对方愿不愿意听（现在想来肯定是不愿意的……）最搞笑的是有一个叔叔据说在家怕老婆，于是大家拿这事儿开他玩笑，话里话外感觉其他人对他老婆好像也不算特别待见的样子。结果有一次出门的时候这个老婆跟来了，阿姨不对大姐姐很漂亮很温柔很好说话，我在想这么好的人怎么会让老公怕她呢，就……直接问出来了。而且这其实还真不是没过脑子，我就是觉得，这么多人都知道他怕老婆，他老婆难道能不知道？既然知道的话，我说出来有啥了不起？</p><p>这事儿后来被我爹吗足足混合双打不对双骂了半个小时，骂完了我却依然理直气壮的觉得大家都知道的事情这么遮遮掩掩的很没道理，不过毕竟挨骂的滋味还是不好受的，那以后当着人面只夸人就好了。于是之后家里跟旅行团出去玩，我很喜欢导游阿姨的耳环，那夸人家总没错吧？结果言辞过火了（“哎呀阿姨的耳环太好看了，我要是有机会就偷走了哈哈哈哈”）然后导游阿姨直接把这幅耳环摘下来送给我了，到了屋里又被父母说一顿。</p><p>中学几年甚至包括大一大二，我觉得我爸妈基本上就没骂过我什么别的，只会骂我一件事情就是公众场合说错话，而且每次都骂得很严重，一边骂还一遍后悔反省为什么小时候没好好教我。我其实从来没有为自己“说错话”感到过内疚（因为当时我真没觉得那些话不该说），可是每次看他们开始反省开始内疚开始自责小时候没好好教我，我心里也非常难受，会觉得自己是不是真的缺根筋，是不是别的小孩就不需要被教这么基础的事情呢？后来我就非常不愿意和我爸和他同事们出来玩了，还在家对着他俩爆发了一次，觉得和长辈出去玩我说的每句话做的每件事好像都是错的，非常累。</p><p>为了避免“说错话做错事”，我在心里默默的记下了每次爹娘教训我的时候说的各大要点——</p><ol><li>要有眼力见儿，随时盯着周围有没有人需要帮忙。——我尝试照做，结果发现我必须得把百分百的注意力放在“他们现在需要我帮忙做什么吗”这件事上，根本没办法真正参加集体活动。一旦自己加入了活动，绝对就把其他人的需要完全抛到九霄云外去了。</li><li>少说“我”这个字，多说“你”，免得你一说话说自己感兴趣的事情吧啦吧啦不停让别人听着很没意思。我到现在依然在努力这么做，不过除了自己感兴趣的事情以外，我非常不擅长挑起合适的话题聊天，最后结果总是会变成我听对方说话接不上话，只能嗯嗯嗯，非常无聊。如果是两个人以上聊天，到最后我基本上就不说话了。</li><li>“说话前过过脑子。”两个人以上的聊天，我说话过脑子的结果只有一个，就是到最后我一句话都说不出来，因为等我过完脑子，别人早就聊过一轮，话题已经不知道又变成什么了。</li><li>目前忘了……反正肯定还有很多</li></ol><p>和我爸吐槽过我按照这些条例一一照办的后果，我爸说你如果接不下去你就不要接，没话说你就站着别说，人要懂得低调才能成大事。可是我天生性格低调不能啊，我从小到达表现欲极强，让我在一群人里面接不上话真是浑身难受。</p><h3 id="Pre-Adulthood"><a href="#Pre-Adulthood" class="headerlink" title="Pre-Adulthood"></a>Pre-Adulthood</h3><p><em>– There can be a delay of several years in the occurrence of romantic experiences, and a lack of progress in the ‘dating game’ compared to peers.</em></p><p>大学四年过的平静如水。很讨厌Lexington闭塞的环境和保守的民风，但是换了环境，我很长时间来第一次有了被小团体接纳的感觉。</p><p>因为有了关系好的女生朋友，我慢慢也发现自己在理解人情世故方面好像真的和别人不同。举个例子，W&amp;L这种90% Greek的学校，以学生背后的兄弟会/姐妹会的影响力把学生群体划分为了不同的社会等级，并以此为依据看人下菜。很久很久以后，我回忆起在学校时候发生过的很多具体的事情，会觉得卧槽这岂不是太明显了吗？但是当时当周围人都在吐槽学校这种糟粕文化糟粕传统的时候，我大部分时间都是——认真听，努力记，回了家爹妈朋友问起来比较方便描述。几个关系好的女生很快就发现，我对社会游戏规则不敏感的程度几近一个白痴，于是很多东西她们需要明明白白给我解释。好在这个缺点不至于给周围人带来困扰，也不会让大家对我有什么不好的看法，所以我也没有因此产生过什么负面情绪。</p><p>经常还是会说错话，做错事，也会一旦自己进入兴奋状态就会把整个气氛搞得迷之尴尬——到现在都还是这样，有时候还会被同事老板提醒😂好在，和之前经历过的冷暴力不同，我可以感觉到大学时候的好朋友们确实是在诚恳的指出我为人处事方面的问题。而且因为她们不会有我父母那样恨铁不成钢的心情，也没有居高临下指责我的立场，所以方式让我很容易接受。点名感谢我们无敌码农三海宝中的另外两位～</p><p>至少大学这几年，我明白了一个重要的道理，同时也动摇了我的自闭症谱系“大家都知道的事情为啥还要藏着掖着”的观点——不穿衣服的皇帝和骗皇帝不穿衣服的两个裁缝都只是生活中最正常不过的人，而那个小孩当众喊出皇帝没穿衣服的真相，可能反而会让只是想偶尔装个b图个乐呵的皇帝很伤心。</p><p>所以，社交障碍依然存在，但不足以影响我的生活和心情。而大学那几年，其实真正让我觉得头疼的事情是……感情问题。</p><p>周围其他女生碰到的感情问题大概都是喜欢上了对自己无感的人，或者是被渣男骗了什么的。而我的问题是……没有问题。感情在我这儿根本就不存在（至于后来菜师傅的出现就不讨论了……感觉他像是天上掉下来的或者毕业大礼包配送的男朋友😂）。不是说我急着谈恋爱，而是我完全不明白其他人是怎么开始谈恋爱的。我一直以为谈恋爱就是，小A喜欢小B，鼓起勇气去表白，如果刚好小B也喜欢小A那么就，灯灯灯灯，恭喜恭喜，闪光灯锁定你们！如果小B并不喜欢小A的话，发张好人卡，小A加油，碰到一个小C，下次再战！</p><p>直到大三大四我才发现……“小A喜欢小B鼓起勇气去表白”这个桥段，也就只会在初中生小学生身上发生一下罢了。大多数爱情的开始，原来都是两个人眉来眼去到一定火候，小B给了小A足够的暗示，小A慢慢觉得时机成熟了才会去表白。除非这个小B是故意拿小A当备胎吊着，否则在小A身上并不存在心里没谱就去表白这种事情，毕竟谁想去碰一鼻子灰啊。</p><p>当我意识到原来大人谈恋爱是这种模式以后，我陷入了恐慌——我读不懂任何形式的“暗示”（因为对自己的社交能力没有自信，所以其实有时候懂了也会装不懂，实在是不敢相信会有人可能对我有好感），也毫无概念怎么去“暗示”其他人（好像我中小学阶段喜欢的男生都没跟我说过几句话那种……）。现在假如有个小R同学刚好和我互相有好感，那么最可能发生的事情是——小R先出招向我示好（动不动就找话题跟我聊天什么的），我却因为领会不到他的意思而没有作出任何回应（男神跟我聊天了，我要不要找个话题跟他多聊会儿聊到个大半夜什么的？算了算了打扰到他多不好！万一他会错意了岂不是很尴尬！），他看我没有什么积极回应也就不再继续坚持了。</p><p>发现了这点后我很灰心，总觉得天生对个人魅力没自信又不善于理解别人话中话的我，大概这辈子也别想有机会谈恋爱了。还好，Twitter实在是个神奇的地方，男朋友居然都可以包分配……</p><p>后来看了一篇文章，是一个女生讲她的自闭症老公的。她说两人第一次约会的时候男的会问，are we dating?第二次约会的时候问，are we still dating?我的天，这绝对像是我会问出来的问题啊。</p><h3 id="A-Long-Time-Later…"><a href="#A-Long-Time-Later…" class="headerlink" title="A Long Time Later…"></a>A Long Time Later…</h3><p>和周围几个人说我是自闭症谱系，在考虑要不要找人诊断一下。很多人的反应是，你觉得对你现在的生活有影响吗？</p><p>坦白地说，完全没影响是不可能的。</p><p>中学那几年在家受到的责怪在学校受到的排挤，导致我一直到现在都对于人际交往有着根深蒂固无法逆转的自卑，以及那种又想做自己但又想讨好别人的拧巴的矛盾感。加上先天情商的缺失，我一般无法判断周围的人是真心喜欢我还是只是表现的好像接受我的样子，于是我总是不停不停的在想，那些我以为是我好朋友的人，他们是不是其实根本就不喜欢我，只是因为某些不得已的原因才包容我呢？然后我就需要冷静下来用大脑思考我和朋友经历过的所有事情——嗯你愿意跟我出来旅行，你愿意跟我出来喝酒，你甚至会主动找我吐槽，如果你不是真的喜欢我的话你应该不会主动和我一起做这些事情，结论，我可以放心了。</p><p>以及，我一旦被归属感接纳感诱惑，原则和自我意志就会变得非常脆弱。除非是可以信任的好朋友，我很少站出来反驳和我意见不同的人，生怕树敌。和人起冲突的方式永远是有多少钱就给多少钱，努力装孙子以求和解。我羡慕身边的理想主义者也打心眼里支持他们，可是我自己永远都做不到站出来表达和抗争。比如说，我很反感大家组局喝酒打牌的时候男生说“多叫几个妹子”，在我看来这种思想是板上钉钉的物化女性了——可是当被多叫的几个“妹子”里面有我的时候，我还是会屁颠屁颠的跟过去——自卑如我总觉得，即使我只是个花瓶，被摆上桌也总比被放在橱柜里要让我安心。然后我一边没心没肺的吃喝玩乐一边隐隐内疚，总觉得有点对不起自己的良心。</p><p>只是，谁的人生是没有被影响的呢？这个世界上，真的有人可以完全不背负任何阴影任何阴暗，平平安安的长到26岁吗？</p><p>在哪儿看过一句话——“这年头你没个抑郁症什么的你都不好意思出来见人。”我可以想象这句话对真正的抑郁症患者非常不友好，但是后面的道理我觉得我是认同的。既然没有人能够真正不受伤害一生平安，那么留下的心理伤害发展成或大或小的心理问题，或自大或自卑或抑郁或强迫或自虐，等等等等。不是太自然不过了么。</p><p>而不需要背负任何黑暗就能长到26岁的人，他们的路途固然平坦，可那是不是也会太乏味了一些呢。</p><h1

Aspie</h1><p>不像我小时候我妈只能摸着石头过河，现在多谢发达的网络，自闭症已然被越来越多的人了解。可能是由于社会差异，我观察到中国和西方的自闭症群体的诉求还是很不一样的——中国的家长们把孩子送到特殊学校去，希望他们能够被“掰直”或者把特殊兴趣爱好开发出来（就《雨人》那样的），以便融入普通人的生活中自立。而西方则不然，自闭症和阿斯伯格有自己的组织自己的团体，会在网上为自己发声，公开表示为自己是Aspie而骄傲，并且让社会能够多接纳他们，感觉和LGBT群体有那么点相似。</p><p>至少在我读的这本阿斯伯格完全指南中，作者（40年的临床神经心理学家）是鼓励自闭儿童让周围人知道自己的情况的，这样可以得到更多的理解与包容。看到这一部分的我当时是不同意的。小学因为学说话太晚被伤自尊后我一直很偏激的拒绝被区分对待，到现在我都觉得“区分对待”是建立在隐隐的鄙视和同情之上的，我的自尊无法接受。</p><p>但是想了想，又觉得我也不能把所有案例都和我自己比。首先我自闭的程度怎么说都算是比较轻度的；其次，在崇尚读书的东亚文化中，只要智商够高能在学校里考高分，一般日子都不会过的太差。反之，在美国这种反智主义盛行而校内监管更为放松的地方，连“书呆子”都可以成为被人打的正当理由，可能如果不特别关照一下的话，自闭症小孩在正常学校里活不过高中吧。</p><p>一个月前还读了这么一篇文章非常有趣——<a

Language</a>里面提到一个现象，大概就是谱系家属提到这个患者时，不会用“自闭症患者”来定义他，而只是把自闭作为他的一个附加属性。而谱系人本人则不同，他会直接说自己“自闭”，并且因此骄傲。我不知道该怎么看这个现象，不过觉得还是很有意思的。</p><p>归根结底，是应该让谱系人努力去适应普通人呢，还是让社会更适应谱系人呢？我想这个社会确实应该对谱系人好一些，至少尽量减少针对他们的欺侮和霸凌。但是一定要让整个社区都来适应谱系人的思维方式，未免确实有些强人所难了。就算是为了成年以后能独立生活，谱系人也是有必要努力一把稍微装一下正常人的。我在自闭社区里面看到不少文章大概意思是，因为自闭不算病所以老子就是不想改，凭啥我们就得去学你们而你们不能来学我们？这我就觉得有点过分了，如果谱系人群不稍微注意一下自己的社交方式的话（比如一说到自己感兴趣的话题就停不下来），不仅是普通人会黑人问号脸，其他谱系人也不会高兴的呀。当然这只代表我现在的想法，以后相关课题研究多了可能想法会改变吧。</p><h1

What next?"></a>Your friend is an Aspie like me. What next?</h1><p>长这么大，我发现父母除外，帮助我最多的人们好像都有个共同特点——会冷静告诉我“我做错了什么”的人。对于自闭症来讲，因为他们无法靠自己了解人情社会的游戏规则，所以能有人一点点教他们是最好的。</p><p>每次我说错话做错事，我父母一个心急把我骂一顿，总会让我之后很害怕和人说话。也有其他和我不熟的人为了不撕破脸，什么都不跟我说，但是心里慢慢会觉得我这人很怎么样很怎么样的，而我还一无所知。所以每次有身边的朋友直接但冷静的跟我说，“你这么说话很伤人”“你刚刚的做法没有考虑到他的想法，他对你很不满。”我都会感激他很久。刚听到的时候不可避免的觉得很刺耳，但是事后冷静下来想一想会觉得受益无穷。不是说可以保证之后就一定不会犯同样的错误，但是至少知道了其他人会怎么想，以后也有个心理准备。而且被提醒的次数多了，多半慢慢确实能够改好呢。</p><p>同时，还很感谢所有让我坚持做自己的人。虽然那时候我觉得他们是站着说话不腰疼，但是回想起来，“做自己”三个字就像一剂红牛，当我每次为自己的人缘感到自卑的时候，一想到至少还有这么一些人是喜欢我现在这个样子的，就又觉得充满自信和力量。嗯，既然你们喜欢我，那我肯定是有值得你们喜欢的地方的，我一定不像其他人表现出来的那样，一无是处，招人讨厌。</p><p>想象一下我这辈子没有听到任何人鼓励我做自己，那我现在会是什么样呢？</p><p>每次试图想象都觉得，心理压力太大了，像火灾中的浓烟一样排山倒海地朝我压过来，让我不能呼吸。</p><p>——那么回到开头。如果我遇到了6岁时候的我，我会做什么呢？</p><p>我会亲吻她，我会跟她说我很爱她，还有很多其他人也很爱她。我也会跟她说，《皇帝的新装》里的皇帝和裁缝并不是坏人，虽然小孩在大街上说出那句“他没穿衣服”是事实，但是皇帝和裁缝听到这句话，也是会伤心的哭的呢。而这个世界上，有太多太多的皇帝，也有太多太多的裁缝，因此会有好多奇奇怪怪得规则，需要你硬着头皮去学习去适应。但你不用急，你一步一步，慢慢来。</p><h1 id="Last-Words"><a href="#Last-Words" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h1><p>26岁了，矫情一把吧，反正一年也就生日当天矫情一下不会觉得恶心了。</p><p>感谢我妈，在我4岁还不会说话的时候努力教我说话，强制性地拉我进入普通人的世界。无法想象您当时有多累多绝望。</p><p>感谢我人生各个阶段，耐心教我做人的你们。</p><p>感谢所有喜欢我，并在我努力把自己改造成人见人爱的人民币时，坚定鼓励我继续做自己的你们。</p><p>最后，感谢给我逆境的众生。</p><h1 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h1><p>本文所有英文引用全部出自Tony Attwood, <em>A Complete Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome.</em></p><p>这本书的读后感我大概用一句话概括——身边那么多活着的亲人朋友，竟然都没有一本死的书了解我，百感交集。</p>]]></content>

      上中学以来和很多人说过自己以前有自闭症。迄今为止，还没有人的第一反应是相信的。

大概都是这样的——“你这么外向？还自闭？”“你要是都自闭我这算啥？”“开啥玩笑呢。”

所以，以生日为契机，给能读到这篇博的朋友们科普一下自闭症谱系，顺便也做一下每个人每年生日都会做的事情——回顾一下自己的人生吧。

毕竟，能平平安安快快乐乐过上26岁生日，对于自闭症谱系人群，好像也不是那么容易的事呢。

Preface
也就是一年内吧，我做了个梦。梦到了和我6岁时候的我自己面对面。她剪了个短短的小碎发（小时候我妈不给我留长头发），别了一头乱七八糟颜色的发夹，小嘴有点撅起来。她和其他的孩子们一起在玩猫捉老鼠什么的
